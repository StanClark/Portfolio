Open the NetLogo file (farming_climate_change.nlogo) in NetLogo 6.3 or 6.4.
There is no need to import or load any other data or files. Experiments can be run by opening the behaviour space and selecting an existing setup or creating a new one. Results should be stored in the relevant subdirectory of the results folder.

The model can be manually setup and ran with the 'setup' and 'go' buttons. Adjustments to agent parameters can be made to the right of the simulation window, with toggles next to each org to activate/deactivate them. General parameters are found at the bottom left of the simulation window. The 'show' buttons adjust the what patch parameter is being displayed in the window, and defaults to 'Cell Profit' when 'setup' is pressed.

The data processing for the SLR experiment stream can be found in DataProcV2.ipynb
Planning experiment stream: 

The figures plotted can be found in the figures folder.
Generated data files could not be uploaded because they were too big.

Data processing for the experiment Look-Ahead-100-year can be found in look_ahead_data_proc.ipynb. This does not create any figure files, only displaying them to be manually saved.
