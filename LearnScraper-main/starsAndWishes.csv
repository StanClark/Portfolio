Organisation of health and social care can greatly impact the delivery and effectiveness of care.
Integrated health care improves on care such as providing personalised care for patients as care will be delivered based on their wants/wishes. It also improves upon the efficiency of care.
We need to keep auditing and re-auditing our data to enable us learn what methods are most effective to use. For example the study on methods/systems used in care homes. How a lot care homes are still paper based and how it is difficult to retrieve patient data from care homes.

I wish I understood better how to organise health systems for better integration. Is there a formula that makes it easier for all the parts of the health and social care system to talk to each other? Or is it mostly just artificial barriers? ","03/12/2023, 22:00"

1. I have enjoyed the presentation by Professor Andrew Morris. He defined the key challenges bringing data science into clinical practice, which are (i) the complexity of healthcare, (ii) the trustworthiness of the implemented data technologies, and (iii) the need to build adequate capacity to deliver data technologies.

2. I have learned about the formal meaning of integrated health and social care, its components, and funding. While I am more familiar with the healthcare side of the system, understanding social care and social services was most helpful. I have expanded my knowledge of the Scottish system to their English equivalents. 

3. Person-centred care is often mentioned in different contexts. I have learned its meaning through the four principles promoted by the Health Foundation. It is important to appreciate that patient-centred care is not about practitioners deciding the best care for their perceived person's needs but putting the person's views upfront.

While going through the week's content, I could appreciate the contemporary health and social care system, the legal framework driving its development and the challenges in delivering high-quality person-centred care.

Instead, it encompasses a
comprehensive approach that involves data cleaning, relevance assessment, accuracy evaluation, and integrity verification.
 STAR 2 – WEEK 4: Data quality is also comprised of uniqueness, a characteristic for which each record in a database should appear only once, eliminating duplication and overlaps.

STAR 3 – WEEK 4: Deterministic data linkage, which relies on exact matching of unique identifiers, is not always feasible due to data inconsistencies and missing information. In this cases, probabilistic data linkage comes in handy as a valuable alternative for linking records across datasets, and it leverages the probabilities of different rows representing the same entity.

QUESTION MARK – WEEK 4: I would like to know how we can effectively utilize probabilistic data linkage when deterministic linkage is not feasible, considering the potential for false matches due to similar values or the absence of significant differences between groups, which would – if present – allow for high-confidence probabilistic matching.","23/11/2023, 15:53"

I've always had a big interest in statistics and how data can be used to make the best possible decisions.

Virtual Hospitals are a fairly new introduction to the NHS, but have been identified as a key priority by NHS England, with the goal that every trust develops services using this model. The aim of virtual hospital services is to allow for patients who do not require the most acute inpatient services and monitoring to return home earlier while still receiving hospital-quality care in the community. 

We provide remote monitoring equipment, and nursing and medical staff call patients daily to monitor their condition. We are able to provide input often on the same day including blood tests, X-rays and CT scans, specialist nursing reviews, medications including IVs, and face to face reviews.

Patients generally prefer care at home if possible, and we expect that the risk of healthcare-associated harm such as hospital-associated pneumonia should be lower. And by facilitating earlier discharges or avoiding admissions, we reduce inpatient bed utilisation and increase system capacity.

Virtual Hospital care is a new paradigm in many trusts, and as we scale our service up, we need to demonstrate that our care is safe, high quality, and cost-effective; I am excited to apply data science techniques to support the development of our service.","16/10/2023, 01:00"

My name is Carl and I work as a surgeon with a focus on abdominal surgery in Austria, but I'm originally from Germany. The German and the Austrian healthcare systems have many similarities, hence, I want to give a brief overview based on my personal experience as well as providing access to key resources. Both systems are based on the so-called Bismarck model. In the German and Austrian version of this model, citizens pay a mandatory fee which is used to provide health services by the state or private institutions. In case people are not able to pay, the state covers the respective expenses. Additionally, a relatively small presence of private insurances exist. 
 From a personal experience, I have often noticed that international students who come for rotations at my hospital are puzzled about the lack of digitization in our healthcare systems compared to their home countries. For example, most of the daily documentation is based on handwritten notes, even though computer-based documentation systems are available. 
Additionally, a major problem we are faced with on a daily basis in the hospital is a reduction of operating theater capacity due to shortages in nursing staff. This is a problem which seems like it was ignored for many years and now we are facing the consequences. Waiting times for elective surgeries have significantly increased, leading to frustration both on the side of healthcare professionals as well as patients.

My name is Shelby, and I am an American Living in Norway. My background is in Healthcare and Social Policy and I have worked the last five years as a research analyst. Now that I am in Norway living with my partner and learning the language, I am working as a mentor at a kindergarten. I find it very interesting that Norway faces some of the same issues in Healthcare and Education as the United States, particularly understaffing. Many teachers are frustrated by high workloads, and there are high rates of turnover for kindergarten workers particularly. Though budgeting is a key driver of this issue, staffing and scheduling are also challenges contributing to stresses on the workforce. I have seen firsthand how difficult it is for administrators to balance schedules between fast employees, and schedule substitute workers to come into the kindergarten as needed. I believe if someone took the time, data science could be used to help tackle scheduling challenges by leveraging data to connect substitute teachers and part time kindergarten workers with the kindergartens that require their services, ensuring efficient and optimized staffing arrangements. Perhaps machine learning algorithms can be used to predict demand for substitute teachers, and identify candidates for each kindergarten or school based on factors like proximity, qualifications, and experience. Data science can also supply insights on staffing trends, enabling administrators to carry out proactive planning. I would like to learn about data science, so that I can help to work on issues such as these. ","25/09/2023, 12:49"

 I am currently based in Scotland, having returned from Australia earlier this year. Prior to this, I spent 7.5 years working for the UK National Health Service, predominantly in London and the South West of England. Since many of our fellow course colleagues have shared informative summaries outlining the UK healthcare system, here is a brief overview of the Australian healthcare system:
 Australia's healthcare system is a hybrid model. In operation is a universal public health insurance programme known as 'Medicare', which provides healthcare coverage to Australian and New Zealand citizens, permanent residents, and citizens from nations who share reciprocal healthcare agreements with Australia. Under Medicare, eligible service users have access to free public hospital care as well as subsidised costs for GP services and medicines. In addition to this, government policy encourages private health insurance enrolment through an age and income-dependent taxation rebate. Enrolment is further incentivised by the 'Medicare Levy surcharge' (MLS). MLS is an income-based tax surcharge for individuals earning over a specific income threshold who are not enrolled via a private health fund.
 The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) is the primary government agency who develop and deliver data sets and statistical reports to support evidence-based decision making for improved health and welfare outcomes, as well as informing health policy and service delivery execution. The Australian Digital Health Agency is responsible for Australia's digital health strategy, which has included the national rollout of the 'My Health Record' (MHR). MHR is a secure digital health record which enables all Australian citizens and their healthcare providers to view and contribute pertinent information to the record, such as current medicines, pathology and imaging results, medical history and documents of care.

Excited for the session today! I have a feeling it's going to be a fantastic course. As for Kuwait, the situation is quite complex. There's the government healthcare sector run by the Ministry of Health, which comprises primary care, general hospitals and specialised tertiary care hospitals. Most if not all HIS systems in all these hospitals are not linked, and the primary care centres are also not linked to the general and tertiary care hospitals. In addition to that, the individual HIS systems in the hospitals are not used to their full capacity, with HCPs still preferring pen and paper records. I'm facing the full brunt of this situation in an epidemiological study I'm doing where I will have to go to all the hospitals individually and look through admission records then extract information from the HIS or the physical files. Ironically, the most accurate diagnosis data is mortality data, which is ICD-10 coded and publicly available. The private sector in Kuwait generally has much more advanced HIS systems, with one centre even achieving HIMSS 7 integration, but they're an exception to the rule. 

I hope that the tools and skills I gain through this programme will help me make a difference and work together with the healthcare sector to increase their capacities and data accuracy and system utilisation. ","20/09/2023, 07:19"

I have to say I got really excited as I watched the interviews available in the Week 1 section of the course, since they provide quite a prosperous and desirable vision of the future, in terms of harnessing indispensable tools like big data analysis and artificial intelligence in a field paramount for our society, as healthcare is.

As Prof. Andrew Morris has pointed out, almost all of the world's industries and araes of society - e.g., economics, advertisement, IT companies, and flight companies, among others - have already been striving to catch up with data science and technology advancements, basically since its inception.

Conversely, the healthcare sector doesn't seem to have been trying hard to do so, especially in my country (Italy), where a surprisingly wide portion of patient-related data is still being registered with pen and paper in many hospitals and clinics as of 2023.

I see studying in this course at University of Edinburgh both as a compelling opportunity to improve professionally as an individual working in the healthcare sector (as a medical doctor, in my case), and to give my little contribution - perhaps just a drop in the ocean, but still water - to the process of modernization and improvement of both the Italian and international healthcare systems.

The VA system provides federally funded care to all veterans, while the UC care system is hosted through public universities that accept both federal and private insurance types.

I have attached the Health and Social Care Northern Ireland (HSCNI)'s Data Strategy for Northern Ireland document. This is a strategic document detailing the data strategy for Northern Ireland, with a focus on data handling, analysis, and presentation.

The strategy emphasizes the importance of data in decision-making, especially in the context of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and presents a roadmap for enhancing data capabilities, including the establishment of the HSC Data Institute.

I've listed key points from the document below, as I know you are all very busy:

Strategic Framework:
The framework serves as the blueprint for data management in Northern Ireland, detailing the core strategies for handling and utilizing data.
It emphasizes the importance of capabilities and enablers as the 'how' to achieve the strategic outcomes, focusing on the implementation of a Data Institute and preparing for data transformation.

HSC Data Institute:
The HSC Data Institute (HSCDI) is a novel organization dedicated to realizing the vision and mission of the data strategy. It aims to reduce duplication, enhance the analyst environment, and ensure better resource coordination.
The HSCDI will act as a hub for data and analytics services, supporting other teams and organizations in developing data skills and capabilities. It will centralize capabilities and drive data-driven, insight-led management decisions.

Data Enablers:
Data enablers are foundational elements required for successful data transformation. They address challenges and blockers to ensure effective collaboration between people and systems.
The four main enablers are: People, Population and Culture; Centralisation and Interoperability of data; Information Governance; and Data-enabling Infrastructure and Technologies.

Strategic Outcomes:
The strategic outcomes are critical focus areas that guide the improvement and optimization of data usage and treatment. They aim to generate high-quality insights to enhance care for individuals.
The outcomes emphasize stages of the data usage pathway, from collection to sharing, ensuring patient privacy and meticulous data governance.","17/09/2023, 15:51"

Locally in Cheshire and Merseyside (UK North West), we have a valuable data resource called CIPHA https://www.cipha.nhs.uk. CIPHA links primary care, secondary care, and social care health records, providing TRE for clinical and research needs. 

The Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) is used in England to send electronic prescriptions to pharmacies and provides well-coded information. https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service

e-Referral Service is used by GPs and patients for booking specialist referrals and creating codes in the patient's electronic health records (EHRs), which can be used for analytics.

Routine EHRs provide a wealth of information, but care is needed to extract accurate and relevant information from EHRs. The changing populational demographics make discussing a single health issue during a consultation uncommon. Typical consultations would cover multiple problems, symptoms, and conditions. It would be beyond the capacity of practitioners to code them all. The codes need to be considered in the context of other data. Blood pressure taken when people are acutely poorly may not reflect usual blood pressure. Analytics should consider the 'mentality' of the practitioners entering the data and how different data types can be considered together. A combination of condition codes with codes of examinations, medication changes, referrals, and booked follow up appointments, along with codes of missed appointments and gaps in medication requests, would give a better picture.

The healthcare system in England is largely structured around the reactive delivery of acute care; for instance, the system processes 25 million acute ED attendances [1], and 6.3 million emergency hospital admissions annually, compared with 4.1 million planned admissions for treatment [2]. However, particularly in primary care and community services, there is a clear aim towards wider health promotion. For instance, NHS England delivers cancer screening programs for Cervical, Breast, and Bowel cancer [3], and nine non-cancer screening programs [4]. The aspiration for GP services to broadly support wellbeing underlies the QoF framework, which pays GP surgeries supplements based on demographic-adjusted population health outcomes.

In spite of the fact that formal and traditional healthcare systems are still a staple in the healthcare field in the majority of the world's countries, I believe that the society would benefit a great deal from updating these systems and from integrating the parameters traditionally taken into account by and within the formal health care systems so far, with more innovative health promotion activities that scientific research has been supporting increasingly in the last decades. To make an example, I think introducing physical and mental health promotion practices and activities in elementary, middle and high schools is paramount. More specifically, recent neuroscience experiments (1) have been demonstrating that undergoing 10-minute mindfulness meditation sessions on a daily basis for an 8-week period can reduced stress and enhance mindfulness and self-compassion among college students. This has been confirmed by even more recent experiment performed in India (2), where meditation and mind-calming practices Yoga Nidra are an important part of local culture.

To conclude, I think that formal healthcare systems as they are conceived in today's societies still have large room for improvement and would definitely benefit from being integrated and complemented by newer approaches that have been so far overlooked to some extent, and that often entail relatively low cost-effective ratios.

Within formal healthcare systems, there are much more quality datasets readily available to be analysed. When there is a collaboration between multiple similar datasets (ie. health outcomes across the US, UK and Germany after X operation vs Y operation), then these results can often have a significant impact for that subsection of the population. For example, we may find that by providing a certain antibiotic cover for 5 days post-X operation, we half the mortality rate.

However, I strongly believe that healthcare starts before people enter a hospital/clinic/GP. Therefore I wish that there was more of an emphasis on quantifying and analysing the impact of the wider health promotion activities that go on across the globe. As our we are then dealing with a much larger number of people that it affects, marginal percentage changes can have a real term impact on thousands of individuals. ","26/09/2023, 20:18"

In most cases, I feel this is likely a resource allocation issue, where there are barely enough resources to treat ongoing conditions, not allowing for much investment into more preventative services. However, one of the main medical aids here does run a program called “Vitality” which puts a lot of emphasis on making healthy choices and rewarding clients who are doing well on certain health metrics. See more information about this here: https://www.discovery.co.za/vitality/vitality-research. For example, if you meet their fitness goal for the week, you earn points which can be spent on various things, including a coffee or a smoothie. I find this program very interesting and would love to see how it, or something similar, could be implemented across the wider population to encourage healthy behaviors. 
Following on from my answer to question 1, I think “Vitality” is a great example where a medical aid is applying data science techniques to data obtained from wider health promotion activities to meaningfully improve the health of their population. I think integrating data, which provides not only medical information but tracks a variety of other metrics that influence health should be the goal across the whole population. However, given our limited resources, and the minimal access to electronic medical records in South Africa, this sort of data collection is likely a long way off. And any improvements in data collection and analysis would be welcome in our health sector. ","26/09/2023, 13:35"

To illustrate, NCDs alone account for over 50% of hospital admissions and contribute to 39% of all annual mortalities in the country. There is a considerable emphasis however on addressing some social determinants of health like water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, food safety, housing conditions, and the organization of healthcare services.

I grew up in the United States but have lived in the UK for 6 years. I grew up near the main campus of the Cleveland Clinic, which functions as a specialist hub in the Midwest and expanded rapidly during my adolescence. I find it interesting to reflect on what I understood as healthcare, living in that environment, versus my experiences with the NHS. Growing up in the US, and in Cleveland specifically, I understood healthcare as designed towards the treatment of ill health exclusively. The American model for funding healthcare positions it as a luxury item and is always very localised to a specific health issue. In most instances, there is a large focus in the US on wellbeing, but at the individual rather than community level. US Organisations that focus on community wellbeing, in my experience, feel very segmented from what's deemed 'healthcare'. This makes for a stark contrast with the NHS which was founded with the goal of achieving broader wellbeing in British society post-WW2. 

I felt especially aware of the differences between the US and UK healthcare systems during the pandemic. The media systems in both countries focused heavily in 2021-2 on the high levels of unemployment, despite the hiring needs of businesses. I noticed in the US that there was very little focus on the long-term health conditions acquired or exacerbated during the pandemic that limited individuals returning to employment in any capacity. While this wasn't necessarily stressed in the UK media either, it was identified as an issue that impacted the whole of society (2022) and one that required a solution that was community-focused, rather than burdening the individual.

In Scotland a distinction can be drawn between the “formal” healthcare system (NHS Scotland 2023), and organisations which impact wellbeing and the broader definition of health (World Health Organization 2023). NHS Scotland does carry out both reactive treatments to ill health, whilst promoting proactive campaigns to reduce risk of developing ill health. However it relies on other organisations (e.g. social care, third sector organisations) to help deliver wider services that impact people’s relationship with health in ways that NHS Scotland cannot carry out (Scottish Government 2023). Note whilst this systems inter-relationship exists, the effectiveness of the approach in my experience can vary greatly in its delivery.

Question 2. When considering how Data Science might contribute to healthier societies, should we focus on formal healthcare systems (in which we may find better quality data) or will our work be most meaningful if we expand our focus to wider health promotion activities?

This question is posed as a narrow choice, whereas exploring both formal and informal healthcare systems together is likely to create more meaningful outcomes. There is also an assumption that “formal healthcare systems” (however one wishes to define this) might have better quality data, never mind if this data is meaningful. My example would be birth and deaths data - in Scotland this is not held within the healthcare system (National Records of Scotland 2023). For some studies you will need to link datasets, so artificially limiting oneself to one area in the broader definition of health would be wasteful.

Data Science has the potential to foster healthier societies beyond formal healthcare systems. By analysing data from diverse sources like wearables, social media, and environmental sensors, Data Science can provide insights into societal health trends and habits (Denecke & Gabarron, 2019). This can significantly reduce the burden on healthcare infrastructures by enabling preventive measures, lifestyle modifications, and public health campaigns (World Health Organization, 2017). A balanced approach that incorporates both formal healthcare data and broader health promotion initiatives is crucial for effectively harnessing Data Science for healthier communities (Denecke & Gabarron, 2019). This approach recognises the importance of utilising diverse sources of data to gain a comprehensive understanding of health-related issues (Raghupathi & Raghupathi, 2014).

Examples of this include cancer screening programmes for breast and colon cancer for example. Another example is in Obesity services which involve integrated community weight loss services including dietitian and psychologists, in addition to medical management and then surgical management, divided into tiers of service. This allows a holistic management of a complex bio psychosocial disease. Of interest, is the role healthcare services play in creating public value. That healthcare services, not only treat and prevent disease but also assist in community health. An example of this is our local hospital using sustainable, local industries for their supply chain and championing local farmers. Another example is the local hospital linking in with local schools to provide health awareness, work experience etc. Public value was studied extensively by Bozeman and colleagues and when placed at the centre of policy making can influence both healthcare and social services (1).
In my opinion it is important to recognise that healthcare systems exist within a wider ecosystem of health and social and societal factors and that analysing health data in isolation of this will not give us the full picture of ""health"". However, unstructured data can be difficult to integrate and make meaningful analysis with so it may be better for systems to start with more structured healthcare outcomes/variables and use those as a template to gain more varied information.

However, my impression is that the majority of NHS funding goes towards the treatment of ill health, with increasing pressure and demand for those services as there is increasing multimorbidity in the UK and an ageing population. 

Initiatives that are wider than the treatment of ill-health that I can think of include webpages on NHS.uk relating to diet and exercise, GP referrals to exercise schemes, smoking cessation services and webpages on mental wellbeing and mindfulness. For example, the NHS page on the ""5 steps to mental wellbeing"" includes information on improving mental health and wellbeing, without specifically being about the treatment of a mental health condition(1). 

Question 2) There is a role for data science in both cases. Better quality data from healthcare systems may be used in data science to perform detailed analysis looking at lots of variables and outcomes, but it may also be used in wider healthcare promotion where there might be less data but a greater need for prediction or modelling of health outcomes to answer questions.

Naturally, Data Scientist tends to work with history, and these medical histories can be seen mostly from hospitals, clinics, and diagnostics records which they can use to make analysis and engage stakeholders or
clinicians to make better patient-centred care and quality health delivery. It will be of great help to humanity for health industries to have Data Scientists in their midst.

From a UK perspective the NHS mostly focuses on the treatment of specific health conditions as they emerge. 

This does involve some preventative measures, such as offering health checks every 5 years for adults aged 40 to 74 and some specific cancer screening. However in my view, given the increasing rates of chronic health conditions (such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes) the emphasis needs to shift much more towards a preventative model. 

I'm interested to discover more about what role data science could have in better targeting preventative measures earlier, in relation to these chronic conditions.

Certainly, it has been the view of certain prominent academics (Prof. Paddy Wall) in Ireland that the “system” should be rebranded the “ill-health” system, as the primary function appears to be primarily reactive, with proactive, preventive, and integrated concepts of health being very much in the background. Coming from an “One health” perspective (the idea that health is not confined to the domain of human activity, but also the health of our environment and animal fauna upon which we depend on), health extends to ensure appropriate access to safe, nutritious, sustainable foods produced, access to clean water, and the mental and physical health benefits of access green space. Looking closer at the narrower remit of the HSE, there are certainly preventative measures that are too part of the system, in terms of the dietary promotion (healthy eating), mental health promotion especially amongst certain at-risk demographics (healthy minds), and immunisation programmes across life or seasonal scales (e.g. influenza). Unfortunately, we appear to be only starting to grapple with how the last pandemic was handled, but there isn’t much evidence of our preparedness for the next – though this is a global challenge, where data science has/will play a significant role.

Aarestrup, Frank M., Marc Bonten, and Marion Koopmans. ""Pandemics–One Health preparedness for the next."" The Lancet Regional Health–Europe 9 (2021).
When considering how Data Science might contribute to healthier societies, should we focus on formal healthcare ‘systems’ (in which we may find better quality data) or will our work be most meaningful if we expand our focus to wider health promotion activities? 
I don’t see why this needs to be a either or question – could it be both? Different analytical applications, and study designs, would be feasible (or unfeasible) depending on which system or scale the question is made at. For example (just a thought experiment), health systems could provide data regarding the non-attendance at key health services, which may highlight under-utilisation and waste. However, those data alone might poorly provide information on why (causation) such non-attendances occur. Ecological “natural experiments” could provide insight, for example, into the demographics of catchments amongst different health service providers. Spatial data on public services, wealth inequality, and even transport and accessibility information could provide a more rounded view of what policies and investments may be needed, and where, to improve attendance, efficiency and effectiveness more generally.

 By leveraging data science there is potential to increase productivity and efficiency within existing healthcare systems and enable improved decision making. For instance, deriving new phenotypes via high-throughput genotyping and use of electronic health records can not only enable early detection of disease but also ensure the use of more targeted therapies that maximise both safety and effectiveness (1). Another example is the use of radiomics to process data collected by different medical imaging techniques (2). The impact of wider health promotion activities, such as primordial prevention of cardiovascular disease, on healthcare systems may take prolonged periods of time before they are fully realised (3). Therefore if we wish to achieve results which are likely to be more tangible in the short term we should consider focusing our efforts on formal healthcare systems.

From my experiences, the healthcare system in Wales predominantly centres around addressing and treating ill-health. Like many healthcare systems globally, it contends with various challenges that impede its orientation towards a broader societal wellbeing. That being said, it is essential to recognise the intention to extend its impact beyond just treating illness. The introduction of the Wellbeing of Future Generations (Wales) Act marked a significant step in this direction, setting the groundwork for a more holistic approach to healthcare in Wales. Although this act underscores the commitment to improving the overall wellbeing of the population, there is compelling evidence that we are still not investing in the best balance of services to keep people well (Future Generations Commissioner for Wales, 2020).

Diego - I have to agree with you that many countries or regions' healthcare focus is treatment - yet, there is evidence that we are transiting to a world of ""Precision Medicine"" (PM). PM will be more customised, personalised, rather than a one-drug-fit-all strategy. I believe PM will be the next phase of healthcare society.

Health in Malawi is strongly related to reduce maternal mortality and to lower in under 5 mortalities. Therefore, to prevent critical situations during labor. Reducing these two key indicators over the past decade, resulted in a huge increase from 55.6 years to 64.7 years (2010 - 2020) in average life expectation (Government of the Republic of Malawi, pp. 11-12, 2022). Also, development cooperation projects, of which there are many in Malawi, which is one of the poorest countries in the world, focus highly on reproductive health. For instance, the Malawi German Health Programme, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, supports four target districts in maternal and newborn care (GIZ, 2022).
On the other hand, the Government of the Republic of Malawi (pp. 50 -63, 2022) has wide range of strategic interventions planned to improve the wellbeing of Malawians far beyond disease prevention.

 Question 2
Formal healthcare systems are usually connected to an integrated healthcare system or host such a system in house. These systems control the processing of healthcare data and are often designed with interoperability to other systems in mind. The providers of this data are hospitals and clinics, but also third parties as home care services or private physiotherapy clinics (­Qudrat-Ullah and Tsasis, 2017, p. 42). Accordingly, health data of high quality will be available not just from the formal health care system. In Germany the ePA (electronical patient record), stores patient-based data in a unified system. Patient-based data from within the compulsory health insurances, but also private health insurance data is covered (gematik, 2023). Combining integrated healthcare systems with electronic patient storage, health data is widely accessible, even from outside the formal healthcare system. So, data science in health should make use of these diverse health data sources such as from third parties health service providers, to gain meaningful conclusions out of the analyses.

NHS has many initiatives outside of treating ill-health, although their remit is limited. Examples are NHS Health checks identifying people at risk of serious conditions, including by providing blood tests, measuring blood pressure and weight and providing lifestyle advice. Other local examples are PCN-employed health and well-being coaches and exercise physiologists who support people at risk of developing ill health. There are initiatives to reduce future harm from smoking, excessive alcohol use and substance misuse.

2. Formal healthcare ‘systems’ should ideally be linked to wider health promotion activities. Initiatives like Quantified Self are increasingly popular but, without guidance supported by evidence, are unlikely to impact well-being during lifespan significantly. Such initiatives are more likely to involve motivated, educated people with access to digital technologies and may indirectly widen health inequalities. The technologies continue to evolve, and the same metrics may not be comparable with newer technologies and algorithms.

From my experience in the maternity setting, I feel the local system is designed towards the treatment of ill-health. While pregnancy is not a disease, all pregnant women in Malta are given hospital care and pregnancy is viewed as normal only in retrospect. This tends to increase the rates of interventions as opposed to midwifery-led care in low risk pregnancies, such as Caseloading community care, where its emphasis is more on normality, whilst also providing a more sustainable model of care (Killingley, 2016). Having just obstetric led care increases the workload on the hospital system especially with the rapid increase in population locally. In order to try and reduce the load at the hospital’s antenatal clinic, some low-risk pregnant women are seen at local health centres. However, this service is still run by obstetricians. With regards to other services, I am aware that mental health support services have moved out of the psychiatric hospital and into local health centres to be more accessible (Government of Malta, 2021). There are also specialised services within the police stations which deal with cases of domestic violence, providing psychological and other support that is required (The Malta Police Force, 2023).

During my time at medical school and recent limited experience of working as a doctor within the UK, social care has always been a big topic in the news, however rarely covered in any great depth at any stage of my training.

We are at the 75th anniversary of social care system in the UK starting with the National Assistance Act 1948 that defines social care to provide home for older and infirm people ( post war ) and to promote welfare of the disabled (Bottery 2023) . Later the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 enabled home adaptations , meal services and recreational activities in addition . Care Act 2014 builds on the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to promote integration of health and social care . It was widely criticised to be dysfunctional and in the way of integration . 

The new Health and Care Act 2022  acknowledges the need for independence in personalised care and wellbeing and provide support in doing so rather than just responding to crisis needs . Greater emphasis on providing information and so there families take control of choices available within the existing resources . 
At the heart of the change is the integrated care board and integrated care partnership . Most importantly the care act doesn’t discriminate one area of wellbeing superior over another and instructs social care practitioner to  undertake personalised needs assessment 


Around 43 per cent of people who approach their local authority for adult social care support receive some form of service, and a further 26 per cent receive advice or signposting ( Kingsfund 2021) . 

The statement above explains the ambitious nature of the care received and fails to elaborate the specifics of care received . 
As data scientist , im curious to create a vision and plan board as part of personalised care using the data to enable support during crisis and long term care . An example is , Thick Local Act Personal (TLAP) is a NHS partnership organisation offering support to councils to provide personalised care .

However, there is no social protection law, relying on programs embedded into other plans. These programs range from subsidies to a cash transfer scheme, tax exemptions, and social services.
The coverage and targeting of these programs require strengthening. The National Aid Fund (NAF), which operates six programs targeting Jordanian households with children without parental care, convicts, people with disabilities, missing persons, divorced women, and female-headed households covered 7.4% of the population in 2010 while poverty prevalence was 14.4%. Cash benefits are also provided by the Zakat Fund, which reaches about 1% of the poor.

An example is Kuwaiti parents caring for children with special needs can benefit from financial allowances, early retirement and a state-funded nurse. Expatriates need to rely on charities or their social networks for support, and many struggle.

I didn't have a satisfactory definition of social care before the course, and I don't think reading around the issue (from the course and widely) I still have one, although I have better ideas around it. The course's starting definition of social care could be accused of being overly broad (i.e. it would seem everyone needs social care), and the further definitions provided can be somewhat nebulous. In my mind I would have people needing social care have a temporary or permanent limitation that requires further support to try and give them a realistically reasonable chance in society to those of a similar age.

In Northern Ireland (NI), the commitment to social care and social services can be traced back to both legislative and socio-cultural foundations. The Beveridge Report of 1942 laid the foundation for the establishment of the welfare state in the UK, subsequently leading to the inception of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948 (Beveridge, 1942). While the NHS primarily addressed health services, its principles of welfare provision permeated broader societal sectors, including social care. Additionally, the rich tapestry of Northern Irish culture, shaped by community-driven values, historically emphasized mutual aid and communal support (Harris, J., & White, V., 2018). Consequently, the integration of these legislative initiatives and cultural imperatives has deeply influenced NI's current approach to social care.

I believe that there is a shared understanding that social care should be available to people in Scotland. Government, local authorities and community-based and voluntary organisations among others are working together to achieve this goal. 
The 1968 Social Work (Scotland) Act, was a landmark piece of legislation which embedded the vision of social work as a universal, community-based service. The 1968 Act brought social work professionals from different fields of practice together within new local authority social work departments. In addition, the 1989 White Paper and subsequent NHS and Community Care Act 1990 represented seminal moments for social work; particularly in the creation of Care Management in adult services. The 2006 report, Changing Live, reaffirmed the role of social work as a generic profession underpinned by knowledge, skills and values.

In the United States, there's a lot of discourse about social programs and their use. The public support will generally depend on the specific program. For instance, there is widespread support for the foster care system, with 66% of people supporting increased funding support in 2013 (Children's Bureau Express, 2013). However, social programs such as welfare have had a much more turbulent history with public approval. While there was initial widespread support during the New Deal era, eventually people began to believe that the system was inefficient, or that people were abusing the system and funding for social programs was cut back in the 1980s (Simmons University). Public opinion today differs greatly by state and county.

The primary health care centre performs a comprehensive set of mandatory services and tasks that include curative, rehabilitative, preventive and promotive services delivered within the facility and through outreach programmes (MoH, 2004). Puskesmas also developed cooperation with a network of community-based healthcare units.

Physicians can establish wider connections through MR, which often leads to connecting rural and urban areas, which is especially beneficial when considering treatment options for patients, that otherwise could be limited due to the area.","13/10/2023, 00:58"

In this setting, all of our patients were assigned a physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech and language therapist, psychologist and social worker as well as their specialist. We had MDTs every week for the in-hospital patients and also had an initial assessment meeting with every member of the team who was involved with the specific patient. We worked with the patient's family members/carers to ensure a safe discharge back to their home environment. We offered psychology sessions to both the patients and their families involved, did vocational assessments and worked with patient's employers to ensure they were able to reintegrate back into work. We also offer outpatient therapy and long-term follow-up for our patients to ensure that they are looking after their health and preventing secondary complications that often arise from the injuries they have sustained ie. pressure sores/contractures.

What I enjoyed about this system was that our patients were given a holistic support system to re-discover life and build a purpose despite their injuries. This system also ensured that these patients were equipped with tools to build sustainable living for themselves outside of the rehabilitation centres. ","05/10/2023, 20:22"

Although this premise of an idea was created before the pandemic, as the name suggests, this system was brought in during the height of COVID-19. When patients would present to secondary care with signs and symptoms of COVID-19, patients would be screened, and providing they met certain criteria (which essentially looked at identifying those who were currently stable but at high risk of deterioration), they were then given a pulse oximeter and discharged home. Once home, they would then take their heart rate and oxygen saturation levels once daily, where a team of advanced care practitioners would remotely monitor them for a period of at least 14 days. During this time, if there were any alarming features, they would then either be able to escalate their concerns to a GP who had input on the programme, or signpost the patient to go back to ED as their condition has significantly worsened, or was about to. 

This system worked fantastically at preventing inappropriate hospital admissions without compromising the safety and wellbeing of any patient. It is a great example of both how technology can be used to improve patient care, and also how it can be used to improve shared decision making between different health and social care organisations.

Paolo Pricoco,HEIN110372023-4,Week 1: Share an example of integration,indexIssue5,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"In my hometown of Catania, Sicily (in Southern Italy), a remarkable example of integration and revitalization can be observed in the district of Librino. Historically, Catania – just like the rest of Sicily – has faced the pervasive influence of mafia’s organized crime and acts of violence that persisted from the early 1900s to the early 1990s.

Librino, once conceived as the modern centre of the city with its population of 60.000 inhabitants, fell victim to corruption in public tenders, leaving many projects unfinished and the district mired in degradation and isolation from the rest of the city. This situation led to poor quality social and health care services, such as a hospital and adequate social support.

Over the past two decades, a comprehensive re-evaluation of Librino has been underway. For instance, a hospital was built in the district, greatly improving access to healthcare services for its inhabitants. Simultaneously, diversified efforts to combat mafia’s influence have been done: initiatives have focused on raising awareness and educating the younger generation about the importance of rejecting the mafia's code of silence, known as ""omertà""; cultural and artistic activities have allowed the community to come together and foster a collective resistance against the mafia's oppressive presence.

I deem that these facts vividly illustrate how health and social care are intricately linked with local politics and policies, which should always aim at dismantling illegal power structures like mafia organizations, especially in areas that historically have been both factual and cultural prisoners thereof, such as the South of Italy in general.

While the link between these elements may not be direct in terms of traditional healthcare services, the revitalization of Librino and the promotion of social well-being are deeply intertwined with these efforts. This holistic approach addresses not only physical health but also the social and cultural factors that contribute to the overall well-being of the community, making it a powerful testament to the transformative potential of integration in combating deeply rooted societal challenges as the one we explained.","30/09/2023, 20:27"

Some clinics, for example, Diabetic clinics, do offer a more multidisciplinary approach to care, including physicians, podiatrists, ophthalmologists, dieticians, and more, all working together to manage their patients holistically. However, even in this example, the services provided are mostly focused on the disease, and preventing further complications.

It is called SCAN Pathway which stands for Suspected Cancer Pathway where an individual over 40 visits the GP for non specific symptoms which can not be categorised in a straightforward manner. They are referred to the SCAN Pathway team where a SCAN Navigator takes patient's comprehensive history, performs a CT scan, Blood tests and Stool sampling. Once the results have been uploaded on the EPR system the patient is contacted by the same navigator with the results and arranged appointments with Oncologists or geriatric specialists et cetera which ever suits. 

This whole pathway takes 2 weeks and it is inlusive of biopsies being performed if there is suspicion of cancer in any of the daignostic tests. It is the best example of integrated health and social care systems as primary care GP is involved, secondary care clinicians and tertiary care oncology team is contributing in patient's diagnosis treatment and well being. The navigator contacts the care home facilities or carers at home to explain the pathway and the results. This Healthcare professional also arranges transport for the patient if they are unable to make the journey for the scan appointment.

SCAN Navigator has embarked on this journey with the patient providing support and continuity of care throughout the pathway and saving the patient the hassle of contacting few different teams for appointments and results.

The first integration is the interdisciplinary model of care, where the medical, allied health and psychosocial teams aim to provide child and family centred care throughout the child's journey and illness trajectory and after death in the form of bereavement support. 

Another aspect of integration is the dual keyworker system for each child, where a doctor and child life specialist simultaneously support and advocate for the children and their emerging needs. 

An example of shared decision making between the keyworkers and the primary teams in the hospitals is advance care planning for children at end of life, where the child/family, palliative team and the primary team need to be in agreement, collaborative and agile in case of changes. This cannot be formalised since DNR is illegal in Kuwait, but there is advocacy from different stakeholders to legalise it in line with neighbouring countries.

For instance, control of Tuberculosis in Indonesia is implemented within the framework of autonomous districts/cities as the centres of programme management, including planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation as well as ensuring the availability of resources (funds, facilities and infrastructure). Since 1972, hospital-based TB treatment was replaced with ambulatory-based treatment, heavily emphasizing the role of primary health clinic. Since 1999, the government launched the National Unified Movement to combat TB, therefore every hospital and primary health clinic has been required to have a minimum of one medical doctor and one polyclinic staff member who is in charge of the TB programme. The basic TB case management policy is based on Health Ministerial Decree No. 364/2009 on guidelines for TB control, and Health Ministerial Regulation No. 13 of 2013 on guidelines for the integrated management of drug-resistant TB (MoH, 2014). To ensure coordination among stakeholders at district level, TB control is supervised by a vice supervisor (VS) from the district health office (DHO). The VS collects data concerning new cases from primary health clinic and ensures a sufficient supply of TB drugs. Thus, the TB provincial team has a role in monitoring and providing technical support to the DHO.

Mothers may opt to refer themselves to the service or a healthcare professional may put in a referral in cases of anxiety or depression (or any other mental health reason). On initial contact, the mental health midwife does what is known as the ‘assessment interview’ where the midwife tries to understand what the mother is going through and assess her needs. There are instances when the mother will benefit from regular chats with the midwife. However, there are other instances when the mother would need input from psychiatrists who might prescribe medical treatment, and/ or psychologists who might offer therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). In such cases, after discussing with the mother and gaining her informed consent, the midwife will involve these professionals in her care plan. 
Through this example, one can appreciate the collaborative work between different professionals to reach one goal - the mental well-being of the patient. Coming from a culture where the doctor is usually the one who ‘dictates’ the care plan, in this team I can see an element of trust between professionals. For example, the psychiatrists trust the midwives to perform the ‘assessment interview’ and judge the best way forward. The team also hold regular Multidisciplinary Team meetings (MDTs) in order to discuss certain complex cases, where the midwife cannot take decisions alone. Although their offices are based within the local hospital, they offer their services in the community too to maximise the number of people they reach.","19/09/2023, 12:38"

I really doubt the quality of data in health and social care in UK .

By gathering and analyzing medical data, for example, we would be able to identify early warning signs, and therefore develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies. Faster diagnoses, better patient care, and higher patient quality of life could thus be achieved.

Obviously, this is valid under the assumption that strict ethical regulations should always be followed when managing people's data. In summary, striking the right balance is certainly important, although there are fields, like healthcare, where data-driven innovation can have a considerable life-changing impact, and perhaps in these fields we agree on being a little more indulgent relatively to other areas (such as mere marketing or business) when it comes to embracing data analysis and sharing.

Sensitive patient information is secure, with a lock available for the patient file cabinets, the EHR being password protected and access to the notes and emails only available to myself, healthcare and psychosocial professionals via password protected emails.

The patients the organization I work support also follow up with government hospitals, and I need special paperwork and permissions in order to access the physical ones, since most hospitals don't fully and effectively utilise EHRs and mainly rely on paper files, which are not well handled, occasionally get lost and contain inaccuracies. Furthermore, the systems in the different hospitals are not linked together, so a patient following up with 4 hospitals and health centres will have 4 different physical or EHR files with different bits of information. Alnashmi et al (2022) found major gaps when they surveyed medical records professionals in Kuwaiti hospitals such as missing records, lack of storage facilities and lack of technical expertise.

To the best of my knowledge, Kuwait's data protection for health records only extends to retiree insurance policy holders, not explicitly for all patient records. Furthermore, Decision No. 42 (2021) on Data Protection Regulation by the Communications and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (CITRA) does not cover healthcare records. There are gaps both in data protection and in data-driven innovation, which I hope can be addressed and developed since Kuwait's healthcare is among the 7 pillars of its strategic Vision 2035 plan, and the healthcare system is going through a massive hospital building initiative.

It is not a secret that today a lot of data is generated, shared worldwide and being useful in many areas of society such as politics, marketing, and health and social care. This does not only helps society in so many forms, but apparently also can be use as a way to manipulate people in so many ways. 

In addition, all the cases that happen every year involving big organizations being hacked and leaking information is starting to leave a doubtful feeling on the society that everyday questions data use and perceives it as a bad thing. Therefore, it is important to know the actual regulations behind data protection and data driven innovation to try and find a balance between both. 

Knowing about all the organizations behind data protection, transparency and strengthening the regulations so that all data haves consent from the user or that it directly becomes anonymous may be the only ways in the near future so that an individual can feel secure about data being safe and fairly used without feeling manipulated.

Overall, the importance remains in data being fairly used and in consequence regaining better perceptions by the society who will, at the end, be the ones giving back more and more data making things fairer and better specially at health and social care. ","02/10/2023, 02:16"
Tom Fowles,HEIN110372023-4,Week 3: Data protection vs data driven innovation,indexIssue7,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"This is a fascinating and complicated area. With multiple competing interests and agendas.

I find these topics frustrating, as it is often easier to identify ""wrong"" answers, while the ""right"" answer remains elusive, and probably doesn't exist.

Data is clearly a valuable asset. The owners of this asset are within their rights to deploy this asset in a way that benefits themselves. As an analogy, the owners of a fancy building in the trendy part of town are permitted to charge huge rents to tenants. They maximise the use of their asset though financial returns.

Data is not always a direct financial return, companies exist to make profit, but other organisations have different outcome measures. A health service may use its data asset to improve the health of its local population. A government may use its data asset to make better policy decisions. 

The owners of data assets have often taken a lot of time and effort (and money) to collect, organise and analyse their data sets. In essence, I believe they have a right to use their data asset to further their organisation's aims. Is data driven innovation any different to data driven pen sales?

Privacy issues are of course of interest. Many of these data assets are created without the informed consent of the individuals who make the data. Regulation is necessary for societal acceptance of the use of these data assets; however, I believe we are at risk of losing sight of what individuals gain through providing their data. For instance, instead of paying with data, would society be happy if individuals paid with money for every Google search? 

An individual does own their own data, until they provide that data to someone else. The transactional relationship between a service provided and the data harvested perhaps needs to be better communicated to individuals, so an informed choice can be made around providing that data.","02/10/2023, 01:16"

Economic considerations
The UK economy and industry benefits from use of shared data, and while this financial benefit should potentially percolate to the individual owners of the data, this is usually not the case, as listed companies need to generate profit for shareholders. Governments should also use any added income to benefit society overall with increased revenue used to fund public improvement projects, especially in the more deprived areas.

Privacy Concerns
As industry gets more insights into individual and mass consumer behavior, there remains a growing gulf between the benefits of data-driven innovation and invasion of individual privacy. Do I want my personal data used so that I can have more targeted ads on YouTube and Facebook to encourage me to spend money that I haven't got? 

Data Manipulation
The article cites an example of online retailers using personal data to manipulate prices based on perceived consumer willingness to pay. Such practices can have both positive and negative implications. While they might optimise sales for businesses, they can also be viewed as anti-competitive and potentially unfair to consumers.

Governmental policy
Governments should take a central role in regulating data handling. This includes widespread population training to improve awareness and eventually improve data handling and improved ethical data use.

It's imperative that there is transparency and informed consent so individuals are aware of how their data can and will be used.

This highlights that individuals should have the right to opt out if they decide they no longer wish to share their personal data. 
I also think, there is a requirement for enhanced understanding by society in general of the implications (both benefits and risks) of choosing to share personal data. This domain has advanced in recent years and has become more complex particularly with increased digitalisation and new legislation.
While appropriate legislation and safeguards are crucial, harmonisation between different jurisdictions may facilitate a more common, streamlined approach and reduce complexity for individuals (i.e. personal data can be used differently in the US versus EU; what are the implications of this). An interesting example of this is the Threads app. While it was launched in the US, It's release in the EU was postponed due to regulatory uncertainty regarding how the app will use personal data (1).

Jaclyn Bennet,HEIN110372023-4,Week 3: Data protection vs data driven innovation,indexIssue5,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"I think that the motivation behind the use of the data is a very important aspect of this debate. In business, using people’s data is often to enhance profits of the business and there is no direct benefit to the person whose data is being used. For example, the different pen prices discussed in the article linked above. In this case, individuals’ data is being used for the company in question to make a bigger profit. I think there needs to be very clear information provided to the customer regarding what data is being shared in this kind of instance so that each person can provide informed consent to allow their data to be utlised in this fashion.

In contrast, in the health sector, and especially in the not-for-profit part of the health sector, I think there should be more freedom given to the use of data for innovation, as this stands to improve the lives and health of the population, perhaps not on an individual level but overall. However, this data is often more sensitive in nature, and using pseudo-anonymisation, as described in this week’s content, seems like a reasonable measure to reduce the risk of patients’ confidentiality being breached inadvertently. In clinical trials, where I work, we put a lot of thought and effort into ensuring identifiers are removed from participant’s records before they are shared with sponsors. Informed consent is a vital part of the clinical trial process so that participants are aware of and give permission for the use of their data.

A concept that I have heard of recently, which can also assist with achieving this balance between privacy and innovation, is federated learning1. This allows machine learning models to be trained on data sets housed locally, for example at healthcare practices, so that the confidential data doesn’t need to be exported to a central location. This concept is still very new to me, but I would be interested to learn more about it.

Again, this is true as long as I am not deliberately sharing this information publicly (e.g., I have an Instagram page regularly showing my personal beliefs or my health condition).

And when is it ethical to routinely capture health data for public benefit?

I think it is ethical do to so, as long as the public is subject to informed consent, whether it is explicit (opt-in) or implicit (opt-out).","16/11/2023, 11:09"

I would feel comfortable if researchers would use my data, as long as I understand what the data is used for and if the researchers belong to a reputable institution. When thinking about the government it would also depend on the case that data is used for. While when used by companies it would largely depend on the type of company, its history and values. 

Would you be willing to accept the risk that even anonymised data could in theory be used to identify you?

I would accept the risk to identify me as a person only in certain circumstances, where the potential benefit of the data would outweigh the risk.

What types of data use do you think should require your explicit consent?

All health data should require my explicit consent, except for data that was given/handed in by me directly (e.g. surveys).

And when is it ethical to routinely capture health data for public benefit?

I am generally comfortable with my anonymized data being shared with researchers and government analysts. In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) safeguards patients identities by setting standards for anonymizing data (Office for Civil Rights (OCR), 2008). 
Would you be willing to accept the risk that even anonymised data could in theory be used to identify you?
To live in a better society, where policy is informed by research and data, I am willing to accept some risk. I think there is inherent risk in many instances where a person takes part in something for the greater good. This is not to say that someone should not allow some risks to be taken at their own expense in order to be a part of a better society. The Social Contract, by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, opens with the statement 'Man is born free, and he is everywhere in chains'. This work asserts that people may only live in true freedom if they are in a society that safeguards the rights and well-being of its citizens, though this safeguarding comes at a price to citizens (Cranston, 2023). I believe that access to data to inform policy comes at the price of risk to individuals. 
What types of data use do you think should require your explicit consent?
I think that explicit consent should be required when in using data, there are serious risks to personal individuals’ freedoms or safety. For example, health data on a person’s physical and mental health, financial information, or criminal record should require explicit consent. I also believe that any data collected involving or on children should require explicit consent from parents or guardians.
And when is it ethical to routinely capture health data for public benefit?
 ""Public benefit"" means that the use of the data will provide some good to the public (The National Data Guardian for Health and Social Care in England (NDG), 2022). It is routine to capture health data in instances such as medical research, public health monitoring and evaluation, and health system improvement.

I personally would be comfortable with most, not all, information being shared with researchers in a NHS Scotland model. i.e. not all information, anonymised. It feels like there are enough safeguards in this country at the moment.

Would you be willing to accept the risk that even anonymised data could in theory be used to identify you?

Whilst I am aware that a lot of information can be de-anonymised, as the above question I would be happy with most information, but not all, to be used for research. And the things that I don't want to have de-anonymised and cause harm, I wouldn't share.

What types of data use do you think should require your explicit consent?

Genetic data, religious data (I am from Glasgow). However I am aware my biases might not work for everyone. In some countries it might be that sexual health services data has to be anonymised - e.g. gender identity, post-assault, abortion status. I'm struggling to think of other countries where something might be taboo that is not in the UK.

And when is it ethical to routinely capture health data for public benefit?

Age old question of who benefits. On a utilitarian view if the government provides services, they should be able to in a broad form use the data to do service improvement. The problem is that the term ""benefit"" is broad and in some jurisdictions, the meaning can be changed to suit whoever is in power. The safer way Is having an opt-in system.","13/10/2023, 16:00"

My thoughts:

How comfortable would you be with your medical data being shared with researchers, with government analysts, or with companies?
 I can share my medical data with researchers and government analysts as long as the data is made anonymous and the purpose for which the data is needed, duration for storage and the right to revoke consent is preserved. However, I would think twice regarding companies as some of the information out there regarding handling of data by big companies show that they can't be trusted completely, especially being that the drive is about profit making. For example, it was alleged recently that a company was using the information from public to train their AI bot.

Would you be willing to accept the risk that even anonymised data could in theory be used to identify you?
Yes, as this risk is only likely in theory.

What types of data use do you think should require your explicit consent?
I think personal data such as health data, biometric data and religious beliefs should only be used following explicit consent by the ""data owner.""

And when is it ethical to routinely capture health data for public benefit?
For diseases of public health importance and epidemic prone diseases, I believe capturing if health data routinely is ethical as this provides opportunity for epidemiologists to better understand the epidemic/disease and respond better with targeted interventions. It is noteworthy that, de-identified data is sufficient to achieve this so that confidentiality is not breached.","09/10/2023, 00:18"

I would be comfortable with my anonymised or pseudonymised medical data being shared with researchers, government analysts and with pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies, provided that I can give my informed consent and retain an information sheet that explains what my data is going to be used for. I would also be pleased if I can withdraw consent for pseudonymised data sharing if I become aware of any breaches. 

Would you be willing to accept the risk that even anonymised data could in theory be used to identify you?
I am fortunate enough not to suffer from an extremely rare disorder or engage in anything healthcare related or otherwise that is so unusual and noteworthy that I will be identified even through anonymised data. I also put my trust in the people using the data to remain ethical and not divulge any of the information if they happen to know me and connect it back to me.

What types of data use do you think should require your explicit consent?
All my healthcare data that contains identifiers should require my explicit consent. Retrospective de-identified or completely anonymised data should ideally come with a confidentiality form that the researchers or analysts using my data and that of others should sign in order to maintain the confidentiality of the individuals whose data is being used.

When is it ethical to routinely capture health data for public benefit?
I live in a region where there is a high burden of non-communicable diseases and lots of risk factors, so big data covering illness trajectories, sociodemographic factors and multiple other health indicators would be useful for different stakeholders of the healthcare ecosystem to utilise and generate insights from in order to support the public and improve health outcomes.

Also bearing in mind the importance of informed consent and knowing that in South Africa we do have protection under the Protection of Personal Information Act 20131, which extends beyond health care information.

And when is it ethical to routinely capture health data for public benefit? Any services rendered by the government, using government funding (and therefore taxpayer funding) should allow for some degree of routine health data capturing. In addition, certain data needs to be captured regarding conditions that are considered important from a public health standpoint. For example, in South Africa, we have a list of notifiable medical conditions that require reporting, mandated by international regulations and local law. Our National Institute of Communicable Diseases publishes a monthly report2 summarising the cases that are notified.

From my perspective as a doctor in my country I would feel comfortable depending of what type of medical data they need, how it is going to be processed and if they are transparent enough. If it is I would probably just accept having in mind data actually saves lives and can contribute a lot to public health policies. 

Question #2:
Like I said in question number one my decision would probably depend on how less likely it is to be identified. The less chance to be identified more are the chances to accept the risk. 

Question #3:
All the data that can be used for potentially damaging in anyway the individual should require explicit consent.

Researchers: I would be comfortable sharing anonymised medical data with researchers, provided that there are ethical guidelines in place. Advancements in medical science and benefits that can result from analysing clinical data can be hugely beneficial and potentially lead to better patient outcomes and treatments.
Government analysts: This would depend on the purose of the data used, how it will be stored, and what safeguards are present against misuse.
Companies: This would almost always be done for commercial gain, so I would be very wary. 

Would you be willing to accept the risk that even anonymised data could in theory be used to identify you?
There is no foolproof way to ensure perfect data anonymity, but if strict precautions are adhered to, and likelihood of reidentification is very low, then I may accept minimal risk, especially if analysis of the data could potentially lead to overwhelming public or scientific benefit.

What types of data use do you think should require your explicit consent?
Using data that could lead to financial gain for a third party, or which could be used in a way that negatively impacts my wellbeing, should require my explicit consent. 

When is it ethical to routinely capture health data for public benefit?
This should be done when the benefit significantly outweighs the risks to individuals, e.g., during the early phases of a pandemic. There needs to be procedures to safeguard privacy, and data collection should be transparent to the society at large, as well as to the individuals from whom the data is being collected.

Collecting insurance and claims data usually went alright, because there were already systems and processes in place for collecting data. However, when collecting data for prospective new quality measures, problems arose because data (new data points that weren't always collected by practices) had to be manually input into an excel table by practitioners. Generally speaking, practitioners are stretched thin (Yang & Carlson, 2021), and don't always have the time, even when receiving incentive funding, to be meticulous to data collection and input. I worked on a quality measurement project for almost two years which, in the end, had to be re-done, because we received such garbage data from sites we were working with. Many times data would be extremely late, incomplete, inaccurate, or in a different format than we, the researchers, requested. We worked very closely with these sites, offering guidance as we checked the quality of data for the project, but in the end, our data was still garbage. Looking back I think if we had more funding, though we had a lot, we could have helped the sites with more funding to put towards the staffing and time needed to collect quality data for us.

Better research opportunities: Quality data should result in more accurate study results, which can lead to medical innovation and better care
Risk management: With accurate data, healthcare institutions can use machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics to potentially predict and mitigate potential risks, leading to better patient safety.
Trust: Patients and the public would be more confident in a system that mandates data integrity and security


Issues arising from poor quality data:

Misdiagnosis: INadequate data can lead to misinterpretation of a patient's condition, leading to harmful treatments or misdiagnosis
Wasted resources: Duplicate / irrelevant records can waste valuable resources, both in terms of manpower and financial costs
Loss of trust: If patients or the public learn that their information is mishandled or inaccurately recorded, it will result in loss of trust
Biased outcomes: Predictive models based on inaccurate data can introduce biases, leading to incorrect insights and potentially dangerous therapy
Incorrect research: Poor quality data can result in erroneous research conclusions, misguiding medical professionals and researchers, leading to incorrect treatments

I virtually attended the 2023 R/Medicine conference earlier this year, and in one of the talks about the importance of reproducible research, they mentioned this case, which was a result of incorrect data entry, and led to catastrophic subsequent events (catstrophic for both the researchers and the patients involved).

Coding practices in healthcare are a challenge in data science and potentially cause serious errors. The challenges of relying on coded data are not necessarily due to coding errors but a reflection of coding practices. For example, in the UK primary care, a typical consultation would have a single code for the main presentation, sometimes several codes with multiple distinct health issues. The codes are unlikely to reflect all health issues or symptoms discussed, which may be mentioned by free text with abbreviations and jargon. The codes could define a broader condition category (e.g., anxiety and depression) rather than a more detailed current state description. This helps monitor the progress using health records and meetings QoF indicators (=payments) but does not provide the granularity of data the researchers (change in the condition severity). A way to gain the required information is by looking at other data, such as a prescription change during the consultation. Some examination data, such as blood pressure, could also be misleading if taken out of context, for example, when a person was acutely unwell and used to analyse overall hypertension control.

As I studied a method called ""Alexander Technique (AT)"", which focuses on conscious control of human behavior and movement, I would expect unconscious patterns (not solely) to influence the consumption of cigarettes for the person under observation.
 One ""mental discipline"" of the AT is called ""Inhibition"". Inhibition can help to alter movement patterns or more complex behavior of a person, as it inhibits automatic response to a trigger (thought, emotion, physical need to move the body etc.). Especially to analyze, if inhibition is an available skill within the person would be of interest.

These would be anonymous allowing the participant to fully express themselves. One weakness with this method is that some people may find filling out an open ended questionnaire laborious and would limit participation. 
Another strength would be that participants are able to complete the questionnaire in their own time, safeguarding their privacy and eliminating social desirability bias. On the other hand, people might keep putting off completing the questionnaire and end up with few participants. In addition, open ended questions might limit the representativeness of the population as we would be assuming that participants are able to read and write. However, people might not want to disclose their identity and would therefore refuse to participate in focus groups or interviews.
There are pros and cons to every method, but I think having an insight of the 'typical behaviour' or preferences of the target population to research might help in choosing the data collection method.","15/10/2023, 18:03"

This will give patients ample time to think about their responses and will encourage those who dislike group meetings to participate. Furthermore, also create a mini incentive to encourage the patient to come back to the smoking cessation clinic to return their response.

The limitation will be patients will get bored and be less adhere to the questionnaire if they were to do it in repetition. I suggest starting the collection of the questionnaire to focus on the beginning and the end of the smoking cessation journey. ","15/10/2023, 14:59"
Kate Browne,HEIN110372023-4,Week 5: Qualitative data collection methods example,indexIssue3,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"My preference would be focus groups using a semi-structured approach. Having different focus groups, which include participants with similar characteristics (e.g. adolescents versus young adults, smokers versus non-smokers etc), would facilitate understanding the perspective of a particular cohort of individuals and their reasons for smoking/not smoking. In addition, a focus group can lead to the emergence of shared beliefs, concerns, values etc. that may not be apparent from interviews/surveys conducted at the level of the individual.

In terms of strengths, focus groups can have an interactive nature which can stimulate dynamic discussions amongst participants. In addition, the discussion in a focus group can be guided via a semi-structured approach to explore pre-defined themes that are of interest thus facilitating subsequent data analysis. 

In terms of limitations, focus groups can often be difficult to moderate and manage. Researchers may have less control over the discussion versus other methods. For instance participants may have disagreements which can distract from the main analysis. in addition, they may be subject to bias. For instance particular individuals may dominate the discussion.

Yes. Hopefully the descriptions were done apriori so that they are accurate representations of the data collected

Is it missing any information you might want if you were to conduct some analyses with this dataset?
For an initial exploratory analysis no. However dependent on the exact question, you might want further information e.g. exact age vs age range

Looking through the description of the various variables, do you think it is necessary (or possible) to analyse all of them?
You can do some sort of analysis on all variables. Whether it will give you a useful outcomes is another question. However some explanatory analysis needs to be done on the variables before carrying out actual analysis for missing or oddly categorised variables. e.g. some of the health boards, when you look into their corresponding data dictionary, have multiple entries. It is curious that this is the case, and it would be useful to have someone with the domain knowledge to explain why this is the case (e.g. administrative reason, or was there an organisational change etc.).

Narrative 
I have chosen to look at the length of hospital stays specifically in dementia cases . Im using this data set to analyse trend pre and post covid, which I think has useful insights on reforms that have taken place during the pandemic and therefore has had impact on the structuring of the dementia care . 
My two audiences are Secretary of the State and social services / primary care - ICB board across NHS . 

Reflective practice 
Within primary care there has been major changes in the care provided to long term conditions post covid and community services are evolving with use of technology like virtual wards etc that seem to have a positive impact on patient's care . I had to filter the data carefully to make sure there were no missing units and as I started to analyse and create visualisations the data story evolved into a meaningful story that I felt, could be addressed to the Secretary of State who wasn't my original audience . I really enjoyed consolidating the concepts of data science and putting together all the data wrangling techniques to test . I was more curious to create meaningful visualisations within the given dataset and explored it with different ggplots ( trial and error ) until I was happy with what I wanted as my data story . I wish I knew some basic concepts of programming like vectors , characters , factors beforehand as it took plenty of time to learn these initially and I feel I may have a better understanding now .

I will use the PET scanner data (PET scanners being used in cancer investigation), and relate this to the exams performed by country over time. The aim is to have an intended audience of a ""device building company"" where they can use the data to identify which countries would be the best to target for more investment in scanners. The report audience will likely be similar, but perhaps geared to the health care authorities of the countries to identify where they would fund the scanners.

I am currently trying to take additional OECD data (GDP and population) to create a better narrative. This also allows me to practice further data manipulation and joins.

I have found the project useful in making me combine all the skills learnt. Exploring the OECD data has been useful, and it allowed me to learn the limitations of the data. My initial plans were to do an exploration of all the countries in the world, and have a map (as in the session by Dr Tibble) to show the data. However on exploring the data I realised I have limited country data, and then reading about the OECD I understood I could not execute this plan easily. I was then hoping to see cervical cancer rates versus a type of immunisation - however again this data has not been recorded. So it can be seen that the OECD has a lot of data, but it needs explored to work out how it can be useful.

As a tip to everyone else - if you are working with some of the other OECD datasets, the countries are in abbreviated form. I was not looking forward to processing this data. I did however do a Google search, and there is a package that can already do this (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/countrycode/countrycode.pdf) - it saved a lot of work, and made me realise that if I search ahead of time I might not have to re-invent the wheel every time with datasets.","20/11/2023, 17:57"

This datathon project has involved a dive into imaging and cancer care, focusing specifically on comparison of MRI and CT scan utilisation between Australia and the United Kingdom. 

After collecting and analysing data on cancer incidence and treatment (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) from the OECD database, I also reviewed the data on relative frequency of advanced imaging in hospitals in the UK and Australia. 

I would also briefly review and compare the healthcare spending between the countries - is one much greater than the other, so as to afford better diagnostics and treatment?

Intended audiences:
Healthcare / cancer care policymakers - consider a closer look at how to improve imaging within hospitals and see if there is any correlation between scans and early detection of cancers which may then lead to early curative therapy. 
CEOs of imaging technologies - hardware and software


Reflective Practice

Cancer is a complex disease with requiring multidisciplinary involvement, especially imaging specialists to review scans to aid diagnosis and monitor progression or response to therapy.

It was initially difficult to settle down on one data narrative as there numerous variables of interest. I initally was keen to look at heart failure data, as this is a common cause of acute admission to hospitals.

I am finding some of the plotting code quite lengthy and complicated. I've attached a plot below.

This may seem odd, but I am particularly pleased with my YAML code! 😂","17/11/2023, 23:21"

b) I will focus on the Average length of stay, both Inpatient and Curative care.
c) Still contemplating on the audience, but my presentation my be told to health professionals and hospital administrators. The report could be for government and NGO

Reflective practice
I was curious to know the Average length of stay in different countries within the OECD countries, then I came across Curative care. So I thought it would be quite interesting to understand the difference between both Variables over the last decade using data values from the OECD countries.
I further wanted to extract insight by understanding the differences across the same countries for both variables. 
Finally, I'm deciding on comparing both subjects (variables) to generate more insight into the report.

It is quite difficult to apply critical thinking while manipulating the data but gets interesting when the codes I run give me what I imagined the result to be. I'm very proud of my data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization improvements, as it has helped my critical thinking of how/when to apply some R functions at respective points. I think R is very good for data analysis as one can use tons of functions to make a good report from a given dataset, and I think it will be perfect for statistics.
It is just to know when to apply these functions in R and grasp the key ones.

Yes, I have learned new things from working on this project, and I'm happy to have selected it because I never knew anything about it before the present.

The data set I chose to focus on is the data relating to consultations over different countries over the past few years. I have specifically chosen the explore the relationship between the teleconsultations and in-person consultations data and how the Covid19 pandemic affected the provisions of in-person services and expanded telehealth services. Australia seemed to have the most complete data and so I chose to focus there. 

For the presentation I am considering having general practitioners in Australia my target audience and pose the question of whether they should be promoting and using telehealth services in their practice. I have tried to show in my visuals with ggplot2 the increase in telehealth service delivery since Covid19 and also compared the percentage of telehealth services in Australia to other countries to show that there is room to scale those services. 

For the report I am considering having health boards/government as my target. The outcome would be to promote increased funding into providing telehealth services. I have tried to show in my visuals the increase in telehealth services in multiple countries since Covid19 and the potential to continue to increase the services with continued funding. 

Reflective practice
I found choosing a specific data set quite challenging. When I first started looking at the data, I was looking for a clear trend that I could use form a question and support with the data, which was very time consuming and quite unsuccessful. Once I changed my approach to picking a data set and a question and then exploring that data set to answer the question, it became a bit easier. 

I was interested in exploring the provision of telehealth services as I think that being able to harness the efficiency and power of these services would have a huge impact on improving the quality and delivery of health care services globally. 

Through working on this project, I have seen that a lot of my learning has come from failing. I have found it challenging, and at times frustrating, to come across errors in my code and try to figure out where I have gone wrong but in hindsight those are now some of the areas that I am most comfortable. One of the aspects I have enjoyed the most has been creating plots and getting to explore the aesthetics you can add to customize them. ","13/11/2023, 14:39"

Narrative and reflective writing exercise
  My data story focuses on breast cancer screening, with a particular emphasis on differences in levels of screening between European countries and how these relate to rates for both morbidity and mortality due to breast cancer. My audience will most likely concern policy makers and healthcare professionals. I primarily used screening data from the OECD healthcare utilisation data and then linked this to data concerning mortality and morbidity of breast cancer from OECD health status data. 
 This entailed downloading and reading data into R Studio, exploring and wrangling the data and creating visualisations. Given that I am new to coding in R, this represented a challenging yet fulfilling experience. For instance, when reading the data into R I had a parsing issue and I made several mistakes when wrangling the data to clean and format it appropriately. Ensuring that the code was written in the correct sequence was also something I struggled with. 
 My analysis shows that:
there is a large variability in rates for breast cancer screening, morbidity and mortality among European countries;
the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on screening programmes in Europe;
countries with higher screening rates generally have lower mortality rates.
The latter particularly enforces the importance of improving the uptake of breast cancer screening, as outlined within the EU cancer plan which aims to ensure that 90% of the EU population who are eligible for screening are offered it by 2025. 
 The main thing that I learned, was how to code in R. While I feel that I have a lot to learn, I understand the basics and can implement these in practice. Another important point that I learned is the importance of understanding the characteristics of the data. For instance, what kind of category does the data fall into (e.g., numerical, categorical). My experience has taught me that this is an imperative starting point for plotting the data effectively. Another take away for me was that the best way to learn with coding in R Studio is to implement the theory into real practice.  ","12/11/2023, 19:09"

I intend to deliver a presentation to Obstetricians and Midwives to highlight the importance of informed decision making when discussing the mode of delivery with the couple. I would like to show the rates of caesarean sections across countries in recent years (data obtained from the OECD HealthCare Utilisation database) and also depict the maternal mortality rate (data obtained from the OECD Health Status maternal and infant mortality database) to highlight the fact that a caesarean section is not necessarily the safest option, particularly when it is not medically indicated. I will conclude by emphasizing the importance of building a trusting relationship with patients where they feel they can trust the clinician and safely discuss their options, and how this could ultimately save lives.
Report:
I intend to address the report to the Obstetrics management team highlighting the importance of adopting a more personalised approach culture within their department. This would mean offering caesarean sections to women in need and not merely focus on reaching a total caesarean section rate as a performance indicator as it could be life threatening. More research is needed in order to understand the immediate and long-term effects of caesarean sections. Therefore, I will conclude by providing some recommendations.
Reflection:
Being a midwife myself I feel that the rising rates of caesarean sections and the medicalisation of childbirth is a constant pressing concern. Whilst working towards building a data story for this project I have gained valuable insights in the topic. I particularly appreciated the fact that this project has given me the opportunity to explore the impact data has on decision making and the difference the work of a data scientist can make in this regard.

I have chosen to focus on caesarean sections (a subset of the surgical procedures data). I am looking at both changes in caesarean section rates over time, and differences between countries. I am considering also including elements from healthcare expenditure data sets and mortality datasets. I am still trying to focus the data a bit more and am considering isolating a specific country which illustrates the story clearer. The main purpose of my story is to show how, in certain countries, caesarean section rates have increased significantly over the past few years. Through incorporating the expenditure and mortality data I want to highlight some contributing factors and outcomes. With regards to audiences, I would like to choose an organisation or group which has some power to change policies to address the high caesarean section rates for the report, and potentially a more layperson audience, for example expectant mothers, for the presentation. 

Reflective Practice
I spent a lot of time exploring the data and potentially even wasted time going around and around trying to find interesting patterns in the data to use for my story. I found selecting the variables to use and the story they tell, to be the hardest part so far. I chose Caesarean sections partly because I saw an interesting pattern in the data and partly because I feel I have both an interest and some experience on the topic, having completed my Community service year at a Mother and Child Hospital.

Once I finally forced myself to make a choice, I found the project flowing a bit easier and have enjoyed playing around with my chosen variables, making different visualisations to highlight different points. The resources provided in the additional course content of Week 6 were especially interesting and helpful. They really drove home the point of choosing the right visualisation and optimising it to suit your needs. I have also enjoyed learning data wrangling in R and enjoyed the feeling of being able to find an answer to a problem I was having through either online resources or the R documentation.

Description:
Trying to find a means of deciding on a theme to work on for the datathon. 
Feeling:
To be quite frank, I have struggled a little to identify a theme I wish pursue for the project, and have already felt like I have gone down several alleyways, but not an idea that has a ""hook"" for a well formulated narrative. 
Evaluation:
I have thought about pursuing a project on immunisation, in terms of uptake and international comparisons, and the need to increase coverage, I then thought about the the relationship between alcoholism, alcohol consumption, pricing and alcohol liver disease and finally the value of cancer screening and its relationship with neoplasm case rates.
Analysis:
I have already downloaded data for three different topics, and explored some associations, but I have not got a clear narrative for the differing ideas. Part of the issue may be my current role in One Health (read: animal health), and not having a base domain expertise in human health. I have tried to read some literature. 
Conclusion:
There are ideas that could be pursued further, but probably require greater thought and/or external feedback.

Shelby Mixson,HEIN110372023-4,Formative assessment: Datathon project data and context,indexIssue8,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"My Chosen Data
I chose to look at mental and behavioral disorders due to alcohol and alcoholic liver disease in the UK, USA, and Norway from OECD's Healthcare Utilization Data. For my second data frame, I selected the OECD's Non-Medical determinants of health, specifically alcohol consumption, for the same 3 countries. I am looking at the data from 1995-2022. When exploring the data related to alcohol consumption, liver disease, and behavioral health disorders, I found there was a very clear trend in Norway’s data over the years with rates in both alcohol consumption and utilization for alcoholic liver disease and alcohol related behavioral disorders increasing. I found it interesting that even though Norway has strict alcohol sale rules and high taxes on alcohol, Norway seems to have a large increase in alcohol related utilization compared to the UK and US, which have more lenient rules regarding alcohol.
 The health and social context of the health and social care data I have chosen
 Norway has very strict regulations on where and when alcohol is sold. Alcoholic beverages containing more than 4% alcohol are only allowed to be sold in the government owned wine monopoly stores. These stores are only open Monday-Friday until 6 pm, and until 4pm on Saturdays. Beer and beverages containing less than 4% alcohol may be sold in grocery stores Monday-Friday until 8pm, and on Saturdays until 6pm. In Norway, drinks between 4.7% ABV and 22% ABV are subject to a tax rate of NOK 5.11 per volume percent and liter, making alcohol prices very high compared to other countries, such as the UK and the USA. Despite strict alcohol sale rules and high taxes on alcohol, Norway seems to have a large problem compared to the UK and US, which have more lenient rules regarding alcohol. Norway has had an incline in alcohol consumption and an increase in healthcare utilization related to both alcoholic liver disease and behavioral health disorders due to alcohol since 1995. 
 My intended audiences 
 For my first audience I am considering addressing Norwegian Policymakers. Because policy directed towards decreasing alcohol consumption seems to be failing, perhaps policymakers should address underlying issues related to increased alcohol consumption like depression and anxiety, instead of focusing on restricting alcohol sales with strict regulations and taxes.
 I think deciding on a second intended audience is challenging and I am unsure about my second audience. I was thinking that the medical community could be a target and the intended outcome would be addressing depression and anxiety. But would I then need to use a data frame with depression/anxiety data? Another alternative would be to focus on alcohol consumers as the target audience. I also think that understanding how to address these different audiences appropriately and differently is challenging. What sort of differences are expected? 
 I also think knowing what information to include in my data frame is difficult. Should I also include mental health data such as anxiety/depression? Would I include tax information or laws?

In the drop-in session today we had a great question from Tracy I believe about arranging the legend (based on a variable) in the plot from the prepare section in Week 5 Topic 4. Exactly as I had mentioned in the call, sometimes you just need to get some distance from your code and return to it with fresh eyes! (the same could be said for editing writing in my experience). We were so close in the session, but having to run to a meeting I missed something quite silly. 

As mentioned, the solution requires some knowledge of a function (specifically group_by) that we are only introducing in this new Week 6 content as well as a forcats package function we have not yet introduced. 

Solution: group data by health board, then create a new variable with the max of our y-axis variable via mutate, arrange rows of the data in descending order according to this new variable, change health board to a factor and reorder the factor levels according to the descending order of our new variable 
c_plot_df <- cancelled_data %>% 
  # group data
  group_by(healthboard) %>% 
  # create max of grouped data according to y-axis variable 
  mutate(max_peak = max(NonClinicalCapacityReason)) %>% 
  # ungroup data 
  ungroup() %>%
  # arrange rows of data 
  arrange(desc(max_peak)) %>% 
  # make healthboard a factor and reorder the levels 
  mutate(hb = factor(healthboard),
         hb2 = fct_reorder(hb, desc(max_peak), .na_rm = TRUE))

We can then put this into the ggplot code from the video, updating the color and group aesthetics to be our new hb2 variable 

ggplot(c_plot_df, 
       aes(x = Month, 
           y = NonClinicalCapacityReason,
           group = hb2,
           color = hb2)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = ""Reordered Legend Based on Highest Peak"",
       color = ""Ordered Health Board"") + 
  theme_minimal()

For the following output: 




The plot does have some other problems in terms of the color palette, but this too could be changed from the default! (more on that soon)

It didn't take me quite long. A few things - year had to be a factor. I also didn't put the year labels at the top - the reason is the layout made more sense on the side visually interpreting it. On the demonstration plot the layout of the years if very odd going down then across. Visually to me having it down the side is easier. A way to make the plot better would actually to correct cancelled operations per population, so that we can. easily correct for size of the health boards. This would need the yearly health board population data though, something to try and find.

Getting the Years to display in different colours. Initially they were in a range of blues but then I realised that they were being treated as numbers instead of factors. Once I changed the Years to factors it worked well.
Facets are a new concept for me so I initially omitted ~HBName and I had an error (""argument ""facets"" is missing, with no default"") but a quick scroll through the documentation on facet_wrap solved that issue.
Grouping the lines by Year - initially I used ""group_by"" instead of ""group"" which caused lots of errors with my line graph. Once I fixed that it worked well.

This model suggests that the author first presents the main points of the story, then provides the visualisation to allow the reader to interact with the data. However, the author steps back in once the reader stops interacting with the visualisation to develop the story. 

I feel this technique was being used by governments during the COVID-19 pandemic to encourage the public to adhere to the safety measures that were being implemented to reduce the spread.
The author presenting the facts -> governments showing the rising rate of infection over time
Providing data visualisations of how safety measures are expected to reduce the infection rate -> allowing the public to see for themselves how adhering to the safety measures will help
The author steps back in to further emphasise the importance of following these new measures.

The process of building the story and designing the visuals is subjective to the author's thoughts and considerations, which is possibly why people are sceptical about their truthfulness, as pointed out in the blog. I feel that data visualisation is a powerful tool to convey one's message but it is the author's responsibility to ensure that the data source is a reliable source.

This stark data visualisation communicated more to us than any dry report or table.

The UK government's deliberate misuse of data visualisation was disappointing, and highlights the importance of ethical and transparent data visualisation. It was often clear during the public addresses that the senior politicians understood neither the data nor the virus.

I was very interested in the R Studio talk by Olga Pierce, and thought that her work was an excellent example of ethical data-driven reporting with supporting understandable data visualisation.

Many years ago when I was first becoming interested in graphical representation of data, I learnt about the innovative initial works of Florence Nightingale and John Snow.

Florence Nightingale used her polar plots to emphasise that the main causes of soldier mortality were mostly preventable.



Similarly, John Snow, who was one of the first to believe that the infectious disease cholera was spread via water, used his early version of a chloreopleth map to locate the contaminated water pump which was spreading the epidemic.


One of the greats in visualisation of data is Edward Tufte, who popularised the chart created by Minard in 1869 showing the invasion of Russia by France. He has described it as the best statistical graphic ever drawn.

There is little doubt visualisation is a powerful tool in corporate communication, and it is extremely popular in healthcare decision-making and research publications. Despite the multitude of guidelines and checklists on good research practice, it is impossible to regulate everything, especially the endless varieties of visualisation techniques. A common example is setting the scale of survival analysis so that minor differences in outcomes are magnified. Furthermore, visualisation can be influenced by data analyses themselves. For example, comparing tertiles or quartiles of continuous variables could lead to different visualisations and conclusions.

The importance of asking 'five whys' definitely resonates with me, as I have often observed attempts to fix a problem without getting to the root cause (e.g. trying to create extra space in A&E because ambulances can't offload, when actually the problem is lack of social care availability, leading to full wards and patients stuck in A&E waiting for beds).

In the bed blocking example, it might be obvious to blame the doctors for not sending the discharge meds to pharmacy soon enough, but there was a possible underlying cause due to cuts to staffing in the pharmacy which would need to management system open to understand these ideas.

Among the solutions was the development of a prototype to avoid a toxic build-up of algae in the Ariake Sea in Japan. The approach used was not only based on systems thinking, but also design thinking which enabled us to think customer-centric. 

The benefit of systems thinking lies in its holistic approach. Rather than just shipping a solution to the problem itself, it takes into account what consequences the deployment of the solutions would have when taking the SoS, the interrelations within the SoI and the different perspectives into account. 

As for the negatives: The systems thinking approach can take much longer than other methods as it is an iterative process in which improvements are repeatedly made. It might happen that not all perspectives are clear from the start or that the proposed solution is rejected last second, hence starting a new iteration. 

Although, for highly complex systems (many interfaces, e.g to legacy systems) I highly recommend using the systems thinking approach, as it minimizes risks drastically and ensures a clean verification and validation process.","20/11/2023, 03:30"

Some of the advantages of systems thinking are helping to plan and create solutions for such complex systems with many components such as healthcare. Systems thinking helps us apply a holistic approach to problems as it relies on the fact that systems in healthcare are inter-related and not isolated. Another advantage of systems thinking approaches are that they require by their nature a collaborative approach to engage and identify all stakeholders and engage them in solutions. One of the ways in which private corporations such as Shell use systems thinking is in scenario planning to plan for future eventualities. This is something we can also expand on in healthcare.

The big pro for me with this way of thinking, particularly with the '5 whys' is that it allows you to get to the root cause of the problem, which can often be a relatively simple fix for a complex issue. However, the danger of this '5 whys' technique is that it can push you down a certain train of thought, as in reality, there are often '5 whys' for each stage of the problem. 

Using the example discussed in the video about hospital beds being full over the weekend, yes the analgesia was unable to be requested from pharmacy as they were shut on the weekend, but using that alone leads us to the solution of 'the week team should anticipate the pharmacy being shut in advance, and so request discharge medication during the week'. However, this solution would then fail to recognise other contributory factors, such as 1) due to staff shortages, no one had the time to do this on friday, 2) the pain team may have come to review on friday afternoon, at which point the pharmacy had shut for orders for the weekend, 3) the patient may have only recently started that analgesia, so unable to assess the impact it was having by the time pharmacy took their last orders for the week, among many other reasons.

useful approach to facilitate risk management (i.e. avoiding unintended consequences within complex systems);
Enhances and facilitates interdisciplinary ways of working as opposed to different entities which are interdependent working in silos.

I see a lot of pros to this way of thinking because nothing exists in isolation. Every entity is going to be affected by many different factors, and to really understand an entity or the problems within it, you have to look at all the components that interact with and affect it. 

I think the negative side could be just the sheer complexity of any situation you look at and how you could get stuck in a loop of looking for more components that could be affecting the system of interest. This could make it difficult to make a decision and have it balance out across all the components that will be affected in turn by that decision. ","13/11/2023, 22:52"

Unfortunately these systems are not perfect and when an 'error' goes through the faults of each system, it can lead to negative effects on the patient.

I think adopting the systems thinking approach can potentially analyse the system and its components in great depth, understanding how one system fits into and supports the other whilst making it possible to identify areas for improvement.

Context understanding: Low back pain is a common presentation to healthcare services throughout the world. Most low back pain does not have a ""serious"" (as in the potential to cause irreversible disability) cause. However it is known that current methods of assessment by a healthcare professional are not good at differentiating between those with serious v non-serious pathology. Different guidelines are available which suggest using a radiological investigation to rule-in or rule-out the diagnosis. However each guideline conflicts in that differing stakeholder wish other stakeholders to take responsibility for this process. Furthermore the definitive radiological investigation is resource limited, and not available in all healthcare facilities in the my local health care setting (and this may be more limited in other locations globally). We need to further understand how we can identify the correct patient group to use a limited resource.

Data understanding: Data is collected by local health care information systems. We need to understand the different systems patients are recorded in first. We need to work out how to easily extract the information. And we also need to be able to easily record a standard set of variables that may help us identify how we differentiate this group of patients. Our independent variable would be patients with low back pain, our dependent variable is gold standard radiological test identifying serious pathology, and we wish to identify other factors which may lead to the outcome.

Data preparation: Data recorded from healthcare information systems. This can be initially exported as data tables. However, currently there may have to be free text extraction and a separate input process for variables of interest (also with a data checking stage).

As part of the data preparation stage, a better method of recording data needs to be created so we can then explore the data in a much faster and automated way, so for easier future data extraction and analysis.

Modelling: Once the data is extracted, we can model the variables surrounding a patient, and compare them to the outcome of interest. A likelihood model would have to be created to see which patients are more likely to have a worse outcome, so will more likely to need quicker access to the limited test resource.

Evaluation: We would have to evaluate whether the model does identify those needing the limited resource more quickly - this would be best measured by those who have delayed access to the resource, but still have a serious reason for back pain. There would have to be iterative steps to evaluate and refine the model.

Deployment: This would need multi-stakeholder involvement, and training for ""end-users"". It must be identified up-front that the process needs multiple iterative cycles to get to a best model. The model then can go through less-regular review with the processes identified.","19/11/2023, 09:25"

Context: One of the measures of quality is degree of accuracy and number of errors in death certification. From experience, there are large numbers of inaccuracies and errors in death certificates. For the individual clinician, as well for families and greater health service and public health, it is important that death certificates record correct and accurate causes of death. All hospital death certificates in Northern Ireland are completed (since 2017) on the Northern Ireland Electronic Care Record (NIECR).

Data understanding: Data are collected by the General Register Office (GRO) for deaths in Northern Ireland, and over the past few years, there has been an Independent Medical Examiner (IME) pilot where independent trained senior clinicians review proposed causes of death documented on death certificates in hospitals in NI and correct any inaccuracies / errors. Data have been collected during this pilot across the region.




Data preparation: Retrieval of data from multiple sources - GRO records, NIECR, and the IME pilot. Most are likely be either retrieved as CSV or Excel spreadsheets.

Evaluation: Compare quality of death certification pre- and post-IME pilot using pre-established criteria - simple errors such as spelling errors, incorrect use of acronyms, e.g., COPD, as well as more major changes that needed to be done, e.g., an issued death certificates on deceased patients that needed referral to the Coroners Service for Northern Ireland (CSNI).



Modelling: Is there any pattern to errors? It would seem intuitive that less-experienced doctors will make more errors - is this the case? Are there simple interventions which can be trialed to improve error rates?

Deployment: In a series of sequetial steps, institute interventions aimed to reduce error rates in death certification. This will require ongoing monitoring to ensure improvement and receive feedback from service users.

The immediate effect to the practicing physician was an increased amount of time spend to get accustomed to the new digital system.

With regards to change management, it actually needs to time to work out the stake-holders and barriers to change, and finding time to address these. Any change also needs to be communicated properly to all involved staff members.

A personal example is that someone wanted to try using a new digital system in healthcare. This was communicated to everyone one day before it started. On ""starting"" no one was trained on the system, no one had passwords, people were expected to learn on there on.

It is not that unusual to sometimes find all of the above in a single patient, in which case you're left trying to infer which is the main cause of the presenting symptoms (causal inference), which have contributed to it in some way (mediator), and which are just innocent bystanders in the scenario (confounders).

A typical example would be someone admitted and being treated for heart failure. Someone decides that an investigation needs to be done to check for pulmonary embolism, and this test shows a possible tiny embolus in a tiny pulmonary artery. A lot of people would ascribe the new symptoms to this, whereas with increasingly advanced imaging technology, it is very common to see these tiny clots which do not cause any significant problems, and yet there is no clinical consensus as to how (if at all) these need to be treated.

Clinical trials are often randomised, to account for confounders, and therefore, hopefully, each arm will be evenly balanced for these confounders. Another way this can be addressed more specifically is by stratifying the randomisation, so that each group or arm is randomised with these confounding variables in mind.

If the prevalence of HIV was not evenly distributed amongst the study arms, its possible that one arm would experience more poor outcomes and this may be unrelated to the drug under trial, but rather due to a high HIV prevalence in that arm.","27/11/2023, 13:51"

Non-identifiable data is securely stored in the ""Big Fluffy"" cloud with strict security protocols. The team, including analysts and NHS Sanquhar employees, has undergone advanced information governance training. Legal bases for data processing are established under articles 6(1)(e) and 9(2)(h), with explicit consent obtained and securely stored. Data linkage is restricted to authorized personnel within the secure University of Sanquhar network. Employee contracts include confidentiality clauses, and a data processing agreement between ""App 4 It"" and the university ensures clear roles and legal compliance. A DPIA was deemed unnecessary based on screening questions.

Obtaining explicit informed consent and conducting a DPIA are crucial steps in the EARACHE project. However, using personal email for data transfer and unvetted third-party services introduces significant risks. Strengthening data access controls and ensuring regular training and audits are positive measures, but continuous monitoring and protocol updates are essential. While the process has a good foundation, stricter enforcement of secure data transfer methods, better third-party compliance checks, and ongoing risk assessments are needed to ensure robust data protection.","22/06/2024, 14:34"

Thoughts on the risk management process
The EARACHE scenario underscores the importance of a comprehensive risk management process for data security and protection. This process should involve identifying potential risks, assessing their likelihood and impact, and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies. The EARACHE scenario suggests areas for improvement, such as using secure data transfer methods, anonymizing data, and implementing strong security measures in the app. By following a thorough risk management process, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and protect user privacy.
In conclusion, the EARACHE scenario serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the importance of data security and protection in research projects. By following a comprehensive risk management process, organizations can develop and implement effective mitigation strategies to safeguard sensitive data.","11/06/2024, 21:01"
Rachael Okon,HEIN110472023-4,Formative Assessment: EARACHE Scenario,indexIssue7,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"Risk Identification and Evaluation:
Several risks, including data security breaches, technological faults, over-dependency on technology, and logistical challenges in data gathering and collection, have been identified in the EARACHE scenario. Additionally, the risk of potential data theft and cyber-attacks on individual health data is relatively high.
Risk Mitigation:
The risk mitigation strategies will involve compliance with relevant legal regulations such as GDPR, as well as the implementation of robust cybersecurity measures to ensure effective data security standards and protocols in the project. Active engagement of individuals or data subjects, as well as regular reviews of the proposed app using user feedback, will be essential to identify and address relevant issues.
Thoughts on the Risk Management Process:
The risk management process for the EARACHE scenario should adhere to ethical and legal frameworks to navigate the complexities of data protection protocols to effectively mitigate relevant risks. For instance, the integration of data anonymization techniques would be instrumental in addressing privacy risks in the project.
Furthermore, the process should be more comprehensive, incorporating continuous feedback and updates to ensure the safety of the app in improving mental health outcomes for users, which in turn could promote individual trust and acceptability of the app. Relevant training and awareness should be in place for users to ensure a proper understanding of the digital innovation ‘App for it’.","10/06/2024, 02:03"
Peony Cheung,HEIN110472023-4,Formative Assessment: EARACHE Scenario,indexIssue2,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"In the EARACHE scenario, risk management measures of different facets are adopted. Legality wise, the applicant stated that he and his company, App 4 It, has completed all relevant legal obligations to ensure legality of the proposed actions, including forming a contractual relationship with the parties involved, completing information governance screening and documentation, and establishing a plan to seek approval from study subjects; the applicant claimed to have connections with two legal professionals, though it is not apparent if they are contractually obligated to assist in it. Information security wise, the applicant stated information will be held securely, implementing measures such as transferring data with encrypted devices, storing data – physical or digital – in safe places, and only granting access to the complete data to two people. Personal data will be collected to link subjects with external data from SPARROW among other purposes, and it is stated that appropriate safeguards will be in place.
In my opinion, the process can be improved. The applicant could have provided more details, such as security measures that will be executed to protect subjects’ personal privacy and any contingency plans for when a breach occurs; the lack of details potentially indicates a lack of substantial planning. More importantly, the process may be insufficient as part of it may be done for the sake of it as opposed to enforcing protection against threats; for instance, answers to the DPIA screening questions seem to directly contradict what is provided in the proposal, but they allow the applicant to skip the DPIA.","04/06/2024, 11:23"
Anita Eriksen,HEIN110472023-4,Formative Assessment: EARACHE Scenario,indexIssue2,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"The primary information asset to protect is data. Some data that stood out as important to protect are geo-location, email address, date of birth, health data (mental health, exercise, motivation) and payment information. There are many threats that could lead to loss of data or access by an unauthorized individual. Some vulnerabilities are related to processing and transportation of data, such as the postal service and third-party cloud hosting service. Some existing controls, like envopaks and physical security, for these are mentioned. However, the most important data to protect is the linked data on the university network, which is accessed by two people on a shared account. Using a shared account is a vulnerability as passwords are more likely to be stored insecurely when shared. However, this could be mitigated by creating two separate accounts. Another potential vulnerability is the university network, which is described as secure without further details provided. The exact vulnerability of the network is therefore unknown. 

The task of writing a risk assessment for the fictional EARACHE scenario initially felt overwhelming. It was difficult to know where to start, especially because there was contradictory information and sometimes little information about certain aspects of the scenario. Some assets, threats, existing controls, vulnerabilities and consequences were identified, but not all were covered, and it was hard to go into depth.

May I ask a few questions regarding the assessment:

Do the 3-5 tables include the SELECT * FROM sqlite_schema?
Is the ER diagram compulsory for the assignment? I know it is part of the course but it was not extensively covered. If required, does it need to include all the other tables created in the subsequent code chunks or only the tables imported from CSV at the start? For example, if I imported tables A and B from the CSV and created table C in my following code, does table C need to be in the ER diagram and SQLite schema?
There is no primary key for the PIS database as mentioned in other comments in the discussion as every prescription is distinct in itself. However, even if I had created a column of row numbers representing the primary key, I would not be using the column in any case in the analysis. In that case, would it still be necessary to create a specific row just for indicating the primary key? Or can I just leave that out?

 3. Should we generate only 1 result table or more? Should this result table be simple (eg. 2 columns and 1-5 rows) or it can contain more columns and rows?
 4. How many views can we generate? Each view is a result table as well? Should the result table be generated by using 1 SQL query?

5. Can I create new tables apart from the original database tables in order to get the final result table or just using SQL queries to get to the result table from the original database tables?

I was thinking about this from an electronic health record perspective. I can see that atomicity is important in the transfer of information between providers such as letter being sent to GPs from hospitals.

The current process is that a letter is created and stored on the hospital system. A copy of this letter is created and then send to the patients. The GP practice then receives the letter and it is filed on the GP clinical system.
There is the potential for letters not to be delivered successfully - which could be due to a technical issue or incorrect GP details being stored by the hospital.

Ideally this whole transaction should not be completed until the correct GP practice acknowledges receipt of the file and stores it successfully. Failure to achieve this should result in the hospital receiving a notification of this.","23/03/2023, 08:50"

I struggled with this one and although I am happy with the format of my answer I can't get the numbers to match. I have explained my thought processes
it appears that the table ward_3 refer to wards in Scotland (SCO)
visit_3 relates to ward_3 (using ward_id) and also to patient_3 (using patient_id) and not to tables with any other number as a suffix
the answer counts the number of patients admitted to each city in SCO but also includes patients where nation and city are NULL

SELECT   nation, 
    city, 
       COUNT(*)  AS 'total patients'
FROM   patient_3  AS p
LEFT JOIN  visit_3  AS v ON p.patient_id = v.patient_id
LEFT JOIN  ward_3  AS w ON v.ward_id = w.ward_id
GROUP BY  city

I am aware that in 2018 EMIS, one of the UK's major healthcare suppliers, were planning to migrate its GP clinical system to Amazon Web Service in order to take advantage of the computing power this would provide (https://www.emishealth.com/products/explore)r.

From a legal perspective the UK GDPR permits transfers of data to other countries where there is no intention that the personal data will be accessed or manipulated while it is in those other countries. The main issues appear to relate to whether the controller and processor of data are UK based rather than the physical location of the data (https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers/).

Would I feel confident about the security of this data and, more importantly, would the public? Personally, if I was confident that appropriate steps had been followed to ensure the security of this data (https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/the-cloud-security-principles), then I would be.

This is a relational database that we use to register patients in the Emergency Department in which I work, it contains rows of patients and columns of information such as patient identification number (PIN), age, location, and triage details. It is slow and is not very user friendly. 

Another database I use regularly is a national imaging database called picture archiving and communication system (PACS). I think this is another relational database which stores rows of patients and columns such as PIN and DOB and Hospital. When you click on this it leads you to the list of images available for this patient. It also contains imaging reports. It is a useful system as a lot of hospitals are linked centrally and it is relatively fast. ","28/02/2023, 21:05"

It has fields and could record almost every aspect of referral, presentation, investigations, diagnosis, care plan/MDT, treatment, clinical trials and pathology. In practice, the clerical teams use it for waiting times monitoring, but the clinicians don't interact with it. The information is spread over six sections and within each section there are numerous tabs - you can't get the sense of an individual without a lot of clicking & viewing multiple screens. Reports are predefined and limited to waiting times and the mandatory national audit data items.

Most investigations and discharge summaries are viewed through an application (mis)named 'Single View'. It has 10 main tabs, leading to other databases storing pathology, radiology, meds etc. There is no design consistency between applications & each takes a few seconds to load.

The thing that drives most of us completely potty is that to get a broad picture of a pt, we need to open several applications.

Mini Report:
There are various certain prespcrption settings in different hospitals. The prescription settings is important criteria to analyze the inequality of medical services in certain area. We want to anlyze the how many prescription settings exists according to area.

We used the information about 15060 GP practices in England (and a few around UK).
We created a barchart.

From a barchart, we identified the prescription settings for 4, GP practice is not equal to all the area.
The population of united kingdom in each city is London, Birmingham, West Midlands in order for high.
There is a difference in prescrption settings for GP practice and population. This needs to be investigated further.","21/03/2024, 23:21"

#Mini Report

We analyzed a dataset from the NHS [1] for general medical practices (GPs) in England and Wales. The data contained information such as the location, name, setting, and years of operation and contained information on 15060 GPs. This analysis focused on the practice setting of GP’s, specifically, GP’s operating in a prison setting.

Prison was one of 25 settings GPs could be classified into in the data. We extracted all GP’s operating in the prison setting to find 149 GP’s across 112 cities. Next, to find which cities had the most gp’s in prisons, we counted the number of prison setting GP’s in each city and filtered out cites that contained only one or two GP’s. There were seven cities with three or more GP’s, two of which had four. Newport, Portland, Doncaster, Shreernes, and Tamesmead contained 3 prison setting GP’s. Preston and Liverpool contained four. This information was then visualized with a bar graph.

According to the HM Prison and Probation Service [2], there are 122 prisons operating in England and Wales, which roughly coincides with the number of prison setting GP’s. Further analysis is needed to determine which of the extracted prison setting GP’s are still open and which are closed.

Your mini-report:

As a junior data analyst for the NHS, I was tasked with reviewing the API dataset for GP practices in England and Wales.

Following my initial analysis, I decided to examine the closure of GP practices to determine if the trend has increased or decreased since the first documented case of Covid-19 (31 January 2020).

According to my coding, 15,060 practices have opened since 1974 (11,580 are currently active, 3,095 have closed, 383 are dormant and 2 are proposed). When the first practice closed in 2013, 11,287 (74.95%) of all recorded practices had opened.

The largest number of practices opened in 1974 (6,648), with the lowest number a decade later in 1984 (25). It was in 2018 that most closures occurred (467) and the lowest number of closures since 2013 was in 2021 (196). As of 2022, 20.55% of all practices have closed (figures tested for accuracy).

Finally, I created a line chart to represent the trend in the number of closures since 2013. The chart shows that prior to the pandemic in 2020, the number of closures was in decline and has continued to decline since then.

I would recommend further analysis of geographical areas to determine how many, and which cities experienced a decline in recent years.

Mini report
This report analyzes the trend of practice closures in England and Wales from 2013 to 2021, focusing on areas with a high number of practices such as London, Kent, and Essex. The data, covering 15,060 practices, revealed a significant peak in closures in 2018 across both general practices (GPs) and all types of practices. For all practices, closures fluctuated between around 300 and 400 annually until reaching 467 in 2018, then declined to 196 by 2021. London and Kent exhibited relatively stable and low numbers of closures, despite a slight increase in 2018. Essex showed a decrease from 18 to 10 closures from 2017 to 2018, returning to original levels thereafter. Specifically focusing on GPs, closures escalated from 38 in 2013 to 305 in 2018, before reducing to 128 by 2021. This peak before the COVID-19 pandemic suggests a significant shift, with closures decreasing post-2019. This highlights the potential impact of combination of pandemic and external factors like healthcare policies and demographic changes on practice sustainability, necessitating further research to understand the underlying causes.","21/03/2024, 09:24"

  We examined a dataset of 15,060 practices within the UK with many attributes, including geographic location, name, type, and operational status. For my particular question, I was interested most in the opening date and the practice's status of operation.
  The COVID-19 pandemic represented a shock to health systems across the world. I was curious whether this shock to the system showed aftereffects of reduced capacity. I proposed to answer whether any practices were able to be opened in 2020. If so, I wanted to know whether those practices were still in operation?
  As it turns out, there were indeed practices opened up in the midst of the pandemic - 360 of them.
  Of those opened in 2020, 337 remained open/active. In other words, 94% remained active. Otherwise, 15 practices closed and 8 were dormant.
  Related questions that merit investigation are whether the number opened in 2020 is actually reduced in comparison to historical numbers of clinics opened per year. It would also be helpful to know whether there are differences among the clinics that closed versus the ones that remained open.

Mini-report:

Using the dataset of prescribing settings in England and Wales, I analyzed the number of active practices each year during the available data period. The count of active prescribing settings ranged from 6,648 to 12,389. As depicted in the figure above, this count showed increased between 1985 and 2018.

This surge in the number of prescribing settings might be correlated with the observed population growth in England and Wales during the same period.(‘Demographics of the United Kingdom’, 2024)

Report
There are about 15,000 GP practices located across the UK. However, not all of these practices are active.The aim of this analysis was to classify all practices according to their activity status. This is important as it would inform what decision to be made about the practices.
From the data provided, it was observed that while some practices are active,some are dormant, some closed and some proposed. From the code, 11,580 practices are active, 3095 closed, 383 dormant and 2 are proposed. The bar chart visualisation shows clearly this trend.
While a higher number of the practices are active, attention should also be paid to the others, enquiring the reasons for closure, or dormancy and how they can be activated again or otherwise. Knowing that only 2 practice are in the proposal pipe line also shows that consideration should be given to if there is need for more or not.

BUSINESS QUESTION:

WHICH CITIES HAVE MOST GP PRACTICES?



Distribution of gp practices in the top 20 cities in the UK indicate that Sheffield is leading at 88 practices followed closely by Liverpool at 81. This also shows that there is more demand for healthcare services in these cities relatively to other cities in England and Wales. Further analysis could be done as to why there is more demand for health services in these cities. This analysis may be important to investors wanting to invest in healthcare.","20/03/2024, 23:07"

Mini Report:

This analysis looked at GP practices which are currently active and studied for the percentage that have opened in the last 10 years by area. A total of 44 area were included in the study.
Areas with the highest percentage of GP practices that are currently active which opened in the 10 years were Bromley, Gwwauin Caw Gurwen, Brough, Cannock and Edgware, which all had 100% of active practices open in the last 10 years. The smallest percentages were seen for Middlesex, Kent, Essex, West Yorkshire and Hertfordshire and the majority of areas had less than 10% of active GP practices that opened within the last 10 years.
Reasons for high proportions of recently opened GP practices could include increasing population numbers in the local area, or new housing being built.

Mini-Report

The Young Offenders, though not forming the majority of the UK population, do still exist. Providing the right healthcare for these youth in their crucial growth years is important. My NGO, ""Youth Intent"", is tracking the GPs specialized in handling such Young Offenders. Unfortunately, I could not find one in the big cities like London, Manchester or Edinburgh within the United Kingdom.

Surfing the dataset of NHS, I could successfully identify the GPs who can care for the young offenders I am taking care of. They were distributed one in each of the five areas, Kent, Lancashire, South Yorkshire, Middlesex and Dorset. All the five GP practices identified were Open and Active.

Visualizing the opening date, I have realized that none of them were opened in the recent years, which requires alarming attention of the policy-makers, because it shows the paucity of resources allocated for this cause.

As an advocacy organization, “Youth Intent” would proceed to lobby with the UK government to create and distribute specialized GPs across the UK, for the welfare of youth, who are prone to committing offences or currently ‘in question with law’.

I don't really understand 'for… in' code. Here are some examples:
 vegan_orders_as_sugars = [ order['sugar']
 
                     for order in coffee_orders 
 
                     if order['milk'] != 'Cow']

In the above example, what does ""order"" represent? How is that stored? What does it do? It is not a variable, is it just a filler word or sugar to help humans understand what is going on?

Here's another example:

#filter for M words
M_words = [ word 
    for word in shakespeare_words
    if word[0].lower() == 'm' 
    and len(shakespeare_words) > 5 ]

What does ""word"" do in ""word for word""?

Can someone explain what is going on here?","14/03/2024, 12:45"

Here I answered some frequently asked questions in Badge 10-12. Most of the answers may involve advanced programming techniques, optional for this course. If you are interested, they will help you better understand python code.
Loop over dictionaries
Looping over a dictionary in Python can be done in several ways, depending on whether you need the keys, values, or both. Here are some common methods:
Looping Over Keys
You can loop over the keys of a dictionary by iterating through the dictionary itself:
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
for key in my_dict:
    print(key)  # prints the keys: a, b, c
Looping Over Values
If you're interested in the values, you can loop over them using .values():
for value in my_dict.values():
    print(value)  # prints the values: 1, 2, 3
Looping Over Items
To get both keys and values at the same time, use .items():
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)  # prints pairs: ('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)

Loop over original data and large datasets
In most scenarios, 'Never loop over your original data' is correct. However, when the dataset is too large to create a copy in the computer memory, a memory-efficient way to handle the dataset is to make in-place operations (i.e., change the original data).
When you decide to make in-place changes, it's essential to approach such patterns with caution:
Understand the behavior: Ensure you know how your modifications affect iteration.
Make it clear: Such code can be less intuitive, making it harder for others (or yourself in the future) to understand. Commenting your rationale can help.
Consider alternatives: Often, creating a new list or using list comprehensions can achieve similar results more safely and readably.
Modifying a list in place can be efficient in terms of memory usage, but it requires careful handling to avoid bugs. Always consider if the readability and safety trade-offs are worth the efficiency gains.

Use cases of infinite loops
There are practical scenarios where an infinite loop is intentional and useful:
1. Event Listening
In many applications, especially those with a graphical user interface (GUI), an infinite loop is used to keep the program running while it waits for user input or other events. This loop constantly checks for events, like button clicks, and handles them as they occur.
while True:
    event = listen_for_event()
    if event:
        handle_event(event)
2. Server Processes
Servers that listen for incoming connections often use an infinite loop to continuously accept new clients. The loop runs for the lifetime of the server process, ensuring it can always respond to new requests.
while True:
    client_connection = server.accept()
    handle_client_connection(client_connection)
3. Real-time Monitoring and Systems
Applications that monitor real-time data, such as system performance monitors, may use infinite loops to continuously check and process the incoming data.
while True:
    data = monitor_data_stream()
    if data_needs_attention(data):
        alert_system(data)

Development tools for advanced programming
If you want to continue coding in Python, here is a recommendation list of softwares / tools that I'm currently using:
Python Environment Management: Anaconda / Miniconda
Environment is the most important thing when dealing with python packages. Sometimes two packages can use conflicting dependencies and cause tragedy to your entire coding environment. Isolating the environment for different projects is a good practice. Anaconda is a popular open-source distribution that simplifies package management and deployment for scientific computing, offering a wide range of pre-installed packages suitable for data science and machine learning. Miniconda is its minimalistic version that includes only Conda and its dependencies, allowing you to install the packages you need.
IDE: VSCode (+ Jupyter Notebook)
Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a lightweight, yet powerful source code editor that supports multiple programming languages and includes features like debugging, task running, version control and remote server connection. Its Jupyter Notebook extension allows you to create and edit notebook files within the IDE, combining the benefits of code editing and interactive data exploration.
Coding Assistant: GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that helps you write code faster and more efficiently. It suggests whole lines or blocks of code as you type, based on the context of the code you're working on, significantly speeding up the coding process and helping you learn new libraries and frameworks. I highly recommend this tool because Copilot reduced at least 50% coding efforts in my daily workflow.
SSH Terminal: Termius
It's a lightweight terminal that allows you to efficiently manage and connect to all remote servers. It also supports some advanced functions such as port-forwarding and ssh passkey.

Is building our own functions to filter and check contents of a list the most practical idea? I feel like there should be existing functions or libraries for this.
Yes, under most circumstances you need to create your own functions to check contents. Because the datatypes in Python are flexible - you can store almost anything in them. It is difficult for pre-defined functions or libraries to decide which contents should be filtered or removed. Some packages such as numpy and pandas will provide some simple functions to help you, such as filtering NaN (Not a Number) or zero values.","12/03/2024, 18:59"

Processing large datasets with list and dictionary
Processing large datasets can be tricky and you need to pay extra attention to the time cost of your program. Here I'll compare lists and dictionary in terms of their time costs, which may help you better understand which data structure to use. In computer science, we use O to denote the time complexity of the program. The larger the O is, the more time the program will take. For example, O(1) denotes the program will need 1 operation to finish the task regardless of your dataset size, while O(n^2) means the program will need to do n^2 operations to finish the task and n is your dataset size.
Access:
List: Accessing an element by index in a list is O(1), as lists are indexed.
Dictionary: Accessing a value by key in a dictionary is also O(1) on average, due to hash table implementation.
Insertion:
List: Appending an item to the end of a list is O(1). Inserting an item at a specific position is O(n), as it may require shifting elements.
Dictionary: Inserting a new key-value pair is O(1) on average.
Search:
List: Searching for an item in a list is O(n), as it might require scanning the entire list.
Dictionary: Searching for a key in a dictionary is O(1) on average, thanks to the hash table.
Deletion:
List: Deleting an item from a list is O(n) because it may require shifting elements.
Dictionary: Deleting a key-value pair from a dictionary is O(1) on average.
Summary
Lists are more efficient for operations involving indexed access and when you frequently need to iterate over items in sequence.
Dictionaries are optimized for fast lookup, insertion, and deletion of key-value pairs, making them ideal for datasets where association and fast access by keys are required.
Use list comprehensions to create large lists instead of using for loop

Tuples use cases
Some of you may find tuples are more difficult to understand than lists or dictionaries. Here are some common use cases of tuples.
1. Fixed Data Items
Tuples are perfect for storing a collection of items that should not change throughout the program. For example, storing the dimensions of a rectangle, the RGB color codes, or coordinates in a 2D/3D space.
dimensions = (1920, 1080)  # Screen resolution
color = (255, 255, 0)  # Yellow color in RGB
point_3d = (3.4, 5.6, 7.8)  # Coordinates in 3D space
2. Returning Multiple Values from Functions
A common use of tuples is to allow functions to return multiple values. This is useful when you want to return closely related values without having to wrap them in a list or dictionary.
def min_max(values):
    return min(values), max(values)  # Returns a tuple

minimum, maximum = min_max([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
3. Unpacking Sequences
Tuples (and lists) can be used to unpack sequences. This is handy when you know the sequence structure and want to directly access its parts.
coordinates = (4, 5)
x, y = coordinates  # x = 4, y = 5
4. Using as Keys in Dictionaries
Because tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries, unlike lists or dictionaries. This is useful for when you want to use a sequence of items as a key.

About list comprehensions
You can use list comprehensions with most data structures in Python, including dictionaries and dataframes.
With Dictionaries
1. Creating a Dictionary
You can use list comprehension to create a dictionary by combining it with the dict() function and a suitable iterable.
keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3]

# Create a dictionary from lists
my_dict = {k: v for k, v in zip(keys, values)}
print(my_dict)  # Outputs: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
2. Filtering a Dictionary
List comprehension can also be used to filter items in a dictionary based on some condition.
original_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
filtered_dict = {k: v for k, v in original_dict.items() if v > 2}
print(filtered_dict)  # Outputs: {'c': 3, 'd': 4}
With DataFrames
Pandas DataFrames are a bit different because they are not built-in Python data structures, but you can still use list comprehension for various tasks, such as filtering, creating new columns, or manipulating data.
1. Creating a DataFrame from a Dictionary
You can use list comprehension to prepare a dictionary and then create a DataFrame.
import pandas as pd

data = {'Square': [x**2 for x in range(10)], 'Cube': [x**3 for x in range(10)]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
2. Filtering Rows
While pandas provides its own methods for filtering (df[df['Column'] > value]), you can use list comprehension for more complex or customized filters.
filtered_rows = [row for index, row in df.iterrows() if row['Square'] > 16]
filtered_df = pd.DataFrame(filtered_rows)
print(filtered_df)

Other questions
How to read JSON into a more columnar format or if that's even a good idea?
JSON generally contains structured data. So reading them as tabular dataframe may lose the original structure information.
If it is possible to change a key in a dictionary with a specific function
You can insert a new key and delete the old key.
Error handling for lists
The list index should always be ﻿﻿ . You can also use try function to handle unexpected errors. ","06/03/2024, 13:53"

Pawel Orzechowski,HEIN110662023-4,FAQ - Course Related Frequently Asked Questions,indexIssue11,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PAIR-PROGRAMMING LABS

Q: What are the lab timeslots?
- Labs will happen over the next 5 weeks on Wednesdays 6-8pm and Thursdays 8-10am. Try to attend one session each week.

Q: Which time-slot should I come to? Do I need to stick to my decisions from the form?
- just pick whichever time-slot works for you best on a given week and attend that. Pick whichever is better for you each week, it's ok to change.

Q: What is I need to be late, or leave earlier?
- if you're late, we'll probably put you in a group of 3 students (one driver, two navigators). And if you need to leave early tell us at the beginning of the lab, so that we can also put you in a group of 3.

Q: How many badges do I need to have completed before the Week 1 lab?
- for week 1 try to complete at least the first 2 badges, optimally first 3. Remember that a badge includes video, coding notebook and mini-diary.

Q: What will happen during the lab?
- during the lab you will be put into a breakout room with a random other student and you will pair-program for 2 hours (see below what air-programming is). Instructors will be walking between rooms to check up on you, and if you'll get lost you can raise your hand and instructors will come to help you.

Q: Will there be extra materials given for the lab?
- There will be a special new set of notes released for each lab (separate from the badges). It is importnat that neither of you have seen those materials before, so that you can tackle the tasks together (rather than e.g. one of you already knowing the answers). We will release it at the beginning of a lab. Please don't peek at the lab materials before your lab, because that will seriously spoil the fun, and make working with a partner much harder.

Q: What is Pair Programming?
- As seen on the intro video: Pair programming is a structured group-working activity used a lot in programmign companies and education. During pair programming, two of you will work on one piece of code together as pair, looking at one screen. One of you ('the driver') will share your screen and will write code, while the other one ('the navigator') will watch what's going on, give advise and comment. You will use microphone, camera and screen sharing to communicate. After about 15 minutes you will switch roles (driver and navigator), and continue working on the same piece of code.

Q: Can I work during the lab by myself?
- Not really (apart of special circumstances). It is one of the objectives of this course that you learn to talk about code, and that you have practice of creating code with another person. And that can only happen by practicing those skills.

Q: How to join?
In Learn open your course, and then on the left-hand-side menu you will find ""Class Collaborate"". Room will be opened for an hour before the session, so you can cope sooner and test your microphone, screen-sharing etc 

Q: What will I need in terms of technology?
- during the lab you will work in pairs so you will need to use Camera, Microphone and Screen Sharing. Without those three things it will be very hard for you to participate. Depending on your operating system setting those up it might work easily, or might need some setup (Pawel will be there to help you).

Q: How to setup my camera and screen-sharing?
Once in collaborate, open the ""pink menu"" on the bottom right. There from the right-hand-side you will find two useful tabs: Settings Tab (⚙️) has an option ""Set up your camera and microphone"". And second-from-right Share Tab (↗️) has section ""Share Application/Screen"". To share your screen, the easiest way is to Choose ""Share Application/Screen"" -> ""Entire Screen"" -> click on the icon of your screen -> ""Share""

Q: Is there a way to test my camera, microphone and screen sharing before the lab?
- Yes. You should be able to go into the 'testing room' in Learn > Class Collaborate at any point (even now) and test if it works. 

Q: When I share my screen, it goes into a weird screen-in-a-screen-in-a-screen-in-a-screen mode. Like a David Bowie music video.
- Don't panic! That is as expected (because you are sharing, a screen on which there is a screen, in which there is a screen...). Just change to a different web browser tab, eg. the one in which you will code, using the top-most and right-most set of buttons.","17/02/2024, 12:50"

Which means you spent 276242400 seconds asleep","I've included my solution for the final task:

## Create a simple program that asks the user about their age and will tell them how many seconds that is (see below note about asking user for input) (NOTE: remember that what user types is always a string, so you'll need to 'cast' it into a number).
## Add anything else that comes to your mind and would be fun.
 
## Create all set variables
seconds_in_minute = 60
minutes_in_hour = 60
hour_in_day = 24
days_in_week = 7
weeks_in_month = 4.35
months_in_year = 12
hours_asleep = 7
 
## Calculate seconds in a year
seconds_in_year = seconds_in_minute * minutes_in_hour * hour_in_day * days_in_week * weeks_in_month * months_in_year
 
## Ask user for age
answer =  input(""What is your age?"") 
age = int(answer)
 
## Calculate age in seconds
age_seconds = age * seconds_in_year
 
## Calculating how many seconds spent asleep
seconds_asleep_daily = seconds_in_minute * minutes_in_hour * hours_asleep
seconds_asleep_yearly = seconds_asleep_daily * days_in_week * weeks_in_month * months_in_year
lifetime_asleep_seconds = age * seconds_asleep_yearly
 
## Printing
print(""On your last birthday, you had been alive for"", age_seconds, ""seconds!"" )
print(""Which means you spent"", round(lifetime_asleep_seconds), ""seconds asleep"")

Output:
On your last birthday, you had been alive for 947116800.0 seconds!
Which means you spent 276242400 seconds asleep","02/03/2024, 06:58"

This principle dictates that patient information must be kept confidential to maintain trust between patients and healthcare providers. The ethical framework of deontology, which emphasizes adherence to moral rules and duties, also supports these policies by highlighting the duty of interpreters to protect patients' privacy and confidentiality.

This went hand in hand with another law that passed in 2017 which prohibited us as employers from inquiring about applicant salary histories. What underpins both these laws is a consequentialist approach to pay equity – as a preventative measure against unequal treatment, for example between genders, of compensation. By restricting data shared with potential employers and requiring data shared with applicants, the idea is to minimize employers' ability to discriminate against different applicants.

Responsibility
I chose this virtue because I believe it's inherent when we speak about stewardship. As health and social care data practitioners, we are entrusted with sensitive information about people and we need to take that role seriously.
Empathy
I believe empathy is important because it is vital to understand the perspective of the people whose actions/care generate the data we're working on, as well as the perspectives of anyone interpreting our findings.
Commitment to truth/transparency
Data and findings can be easily manipulated, even unintentionally. I think it's important for data practitioners to be fully onboard with always pursuing truth to the best of our ability and being committed to transparency in our methods.","14/01/2024, 01:48"

It seems that many of you have found the content of week 1 interesting and positively challenging! At the moment, most of the questions/concerns seem to revolve around three main points:

How to apply ethical frameworks in practice;
How to reconcile/navigate different legal contexts and ethical practice;
The difference between data ethics and similar or adjacent branches of applied ethics (computer ethics, bioethics).

Luckily, week 2, 3, and 4 will help us address the first two points! Specifically, in week 2 and 3, we will look at some practical examples of ethical challenges in health and social care contexts and we will explore some of the key concepts and tools necessary to judge and act ethically in practice. In week 4, we will look at the implications of regulatory frameworks for ethical data practice.

As per the final point (what is the difference between data ethics vs other forms of applied ethics?), this alone would perhaps deserve a discussion board! While data ethics typically focuses on the ethical challenges arising from the use of data itself, rather than from the use of specific technologies (e.g. computer ethics) or from specific biomedical practices (e.g. bioethics or medical ethics), some of you have rightly pointed to the continuity between these different, yet related, forms of ethics. We will see throughout the course that due to complex nature of data practices (which can often include algorithms, code, platform infrastructures, hardware, etc.) and their application in health and social care contexts (which can require the development and prioritization of particular ethical values over others), the line between these different ethical domains is indeed a bit blurry (as someone observed in the comments)! Hopefully, this course will help you put together an ethical toolbox that is appropriate to assess and address ethical challenges arising from a variety of data uses and practices.

Hope this helps! Happy to continue the conversation over the next few weeks.

I am unsure if there is a moral responsibility to share our data as it presupposes information on 3 attributes, that being the ownership of data in the 'our', what and whether morality should be applied to such an activity, and what data it is referring to as not all data is of the same quality or concern. If one can attribute ownership on to data and not find it as an associated attribute, and if one can add a moral constitute towards it where there is an assumption of the greatest good then I would argue yes we do have a moral imperative towards sharing data, but only data that is then used for the common and communal good.

If so, why, if not, why not? Do you consider this to be an absolute responsiblity or are there some limitations? If so, what are these limitations and why have you chosen them?

I do believe that we have a moral responsibility to share our data, since this will accelerate scientific research by facilitating collaboration, reproducibility, transparency and knowledge exchange. This practice has been put into action, particularly within the research context:
Various scientific journals make data statement and availability a compulsory disclosure within the manuscript.
Leading conferences in computer science, especially within the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, have encouraged authors to make their code/algorithm publicly available for reproducibility.

However, this responsibility is not an absolute obligation, and ethical aspects must also be taken to consideration, such as confidentiality and consent. Data sharing practices must adhere to local/global regulations and incorporate the principle of ""do no harm"" in medicine by prioritizing the well-being and safety of the individuals involved, while taking appropriate measures to mitigate any misuse and misinterpretation of data.

Yingqian Tang,HEIN110592023-4,Week 2: Interests and responsibilities,indexIssue6,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"1.Yes.vThis is because:
Advancing Knowledge: Sharing data fuels scientific progress, innovation, and societal understanding. Collaborative research relies on open data.
Public Good: Data can address critical challenges (e.g., healthcare) that affect humanity. Sharing benefits society.
Transparency: Organizations collecting data (e.g., tech companies, governments) should be transparent about their practices.
Informed Decision-Making: Shared data informs policy, public health, and individual choices.

2.As for the moral responsibility to share data, it depends on the context and potential benefits versus risks. In some cases, sharing data can advance scientific knowledge, improve public health, and benefit society, aligning with ethical principles of beneficence and justice. However, considerations of privacy, consent, and potential harm must be carefully evaluated. While there may be a moral obligation to share data in certain circumstances, such as public health emergencies, this responsibility is not absolute and must be balanced with individual rights and ethical considerations. Thus, limitations may include ensuring data security, protecting privacy, and obtaining informed consent, reflecting a nuanced approach to ethical data sharing.","15/02/2024, 22:15"

I do not think that it is a moral responsibility since there are clearly some power dynamics behind obtaining patient’s data to use them in data analysing using algorithms. I think that yes, to some extent and with the adequate data protection laws data can be share but it’s more a governmental need; it’s not a moral obligation of the individual. This is related to seeing data as a public good and therefore protected and regulated by the state for the well-being of individuals. So, definitely no. There is nothing moral behind it and I would claim the opposite. Although it is important for scientific advancement and preventive care to have data about let’s say genomic – it should be good that it is regulated and protected by the state. This is because there are data privacy breaches, discrimination and stigma, disenfranchisement, disempowerment, and exploitation. In general patients are not protected enough by this emerging datafication. This goes beyond the question of ownership and moral obligation since their data have a value only if they are seen as a public good which benefit society and future generation. This claim should aim to protect people from data misuse.","09/02/2024, 00:21"

I believe that a moral responsibility exists to share data to an extent, however, I do not regard this as an absolute obligation. It is challenging to define 'reasonable expectation' both in terms of privacy and sharing of data due to the subjective interpretation of both these variables. Consequently, making data sharing an absolute moral obligation is unethical to me, since it has the potential to harm or risk harm to individuals who may be disadvantaged by the consequences of sharing data; this could manifest in both an individual form or collective form based on the nature of the data being shared. That said, there are clearly scenarios where the sharing of data has potential to generally benefit ‘society’ and should be encouraged where there is potential benefit to individuals or groups which does cause detriment to other individuals or groups. Defining and measuring ‘detriment’ however, is again, not straightforward.

I am not sure however that currently there is enough understanding about what potential harms people may also be exposing themselves to by sharing their data. It appears to me that currently the power asymmetries in the sharing of health data, where information is mainly flowing upwards to companies and health systems and there is significant uncertainty over how that data is and should be used, means that the trade off is perhaps too high to accept data sharing as a moral responsibility.

Considering the numerous benefits of proper data usage to humanity in solving problems and bringing on innovations,  which could result in better health, better lives and a happier society, then sharing data will be considered a moral responsibility. This way, we can contribute to society's greater good by promoting good and removing harm (beneficence). 
However, this will only be a moral responsibility when there is trust in the use of data. The purpose is defeated in cases of data misuse. While this should be an absolute moral responsibility, a lack of trust can be a great drawback.
In building trust, transparency and information are very important. Even with trust in place, individuals must be allowed to decide if they want to or not (voluntarily), and our autonomy is exercised as individuals still have to decide what to share, depending on sensitivity and cost to them.

I believe having a moral responsibility to share our data relies on the assumption that use of our data will be for beneficial or good outcomes to us, individually, or wider society. In the context of health and social research, sharing data may be justifiable for advancing scientific knowledge or social welfare and innovation, but big tech companies collaborating with public health institutions (see Google’s AI subsidiary, DeepMind) raises concerns on privacy and transparency. 

The sharing of health-related data and personal data, derived from individual’s consumer behavioural patterns in using tech services and products, I think raises questions around exploitation of sharing our health data where big tech companies stand to monetise from health data. As mentioned in the course materials, some issues around big data in this context include loss of privacy, transparency of future data uses, algorithm bias and discrimination. ","18/01/2024, 15:20"

As I work in healthcare and clinical research one of the main injustices I like to bring up is related to the HeLa Cells which has helped revolutionise modern medical cellular practices. HeLa cells are named after the woman who 'donated' them, Henrietta Lacks, who was a black woman in her 30s born in 1920s rural USA. This combination of sociocultural attributes continued on to explain her poor socioeconomic standing which contributed to her attending the John Hopkins University hospital when she noticed a cell mass she was concerned about. In this hospital in lieu of payment they took her biopsy for medical research. These cells were unique and could withstand extreme environments and have since become the staple cell cultures to use in biomedical research when needing to grow materials for research, use as a baseline comparison, or know how medicine works. These cells have helped develop the polio and hep C vaccine, have been sent to space, and had a nuclear blast enforced upon it. 

Now you may ask why is this an issue with justice? Henrietta Lacks, nor her family were ever paid for this, and until recently have had little input into the use of storage of their ancestors remains.

COMPAS takes into account several factors, including demographic characteristics, current employment and communal status, and criminal history.

Several investigation has been conducted to assess concerns regarding accuracy, fairness and transparency of the results provided by this tool. In 2016, Julia Angwin and Jeff Larson, two employees of Propublica, stated in their report that:
""blacks are almost twice as likely as whites to be labelled a hgiher risk but not actually re-offend"", and ""they (whites) are much more likely than blacks to be labelled lower risk but go on to comit other crimes"";

Ideally, we would build a model assigning a risk score according to how likely enrollees are to churn so that outreach can be directed more efficiently. However, if we are unintentionally directing resources away from someone who would in fact be helped by outreach or is struggling to keep their eligibility but does not come up as high risk in the output of our model, then questions of justice come in to play.

Free, large, open-source voice datasets incur data justice concerns, as they are generally heavily biased towards male accents and lack examples of regional/cultural dialects.

Implementing any voice recognition using this data is concerning for a number of ethical reasons - predominantly generating technology that works poorly for women and global majority persons. Further bias encoding is seen as accents can relate to race, socioeconomic status etc.

As uses of voice recognition become more ubiquitous, the advantages of technology working well for individuals increases. This raises questions for procedural and distributive justice, the process of interacting with technology differs - having to pause to recorrect or enter using text, this allows the most represented to receive unequal benefit from the technology.

Previously, this system was primarily paper based and response rates varied drastically between education providers. The new national system allowed an equal opportunity for every student to provide feedback and for this data to be reviewed directly by the clinical teams. 

Students are kept anonymous unless there was something particularly concerning in their feedback, for example concerns around patient safety. Additionally, if feedback is given that can identify a staff member or patient, the whole form is removed, not just the free text fields. I would consider this to be data injustice because it is more likely that negative feedback would be removed, but another option was not in budget at the time.

Consequently for justice, this excludes from the dataset individuals who also may be facing food insecurity but have not attended a foodbank which could result in data bias and misleading judgments about levels of food insecurity. It also disguises factors such as stigma or lack of awareness that prevents people from accessing food despite a need for it, and these factors need to be addressed to improve outcomes for people.

It is well recorded that delayed joint replacements have a detrimental impact on patients, including worse postoperative outcomes, depression and increased reliance on opioid painkillers. 

We have recently undertaken a review of patients on our waiting list. We know that the need for a joint is greatest for patients living in the most deprived areas and we also identified a strong relationship between occupational social class and need, with the lowest social class having the greatest surgical need. 

We surveyed the same cohort of patients twice the first send-out was when they had been on the waiting list for at least 6 months we then sent a second questionnaire a year later. Quite a number, of those who could afford it, had paid to have their surgery privately but the vast majority were still waiting and their outcomes indicate strongly that they are deteriorating both physically and mentally. Some of the stories we hear are tragic. 

I cannot say if our department harbours any bias when selecting who gets prioritised for surgery but it is clear from our PROMs data that some members of society do feel that they are being discriminated against.

However, nearly 30% of patients in the peripheral regions, regardless of age, did not seek regular admission.

Initially attributed to the perceived reduced severity of their disease, we identified a more serious issue. The underlying explanation was twofold: a lack of awareness about hemophilia, which resulted in underreporting, and a scarcity of adequate care centers in the surrounding areas. This discrepancy highlights a case of data injustice due to socioeconomic class, geographic location, and poverty. It is clear that hemophilia patients in the periphery were not receiving adequate treatment, indicating systemic inequities in healthcare access and education.

Healthcare algorithms often contain data from individual’s Electronic Health Records (EHR) to improve treatments, diagnoses, and overall individual outcomes. However, these algorithms are usually trained on historical data that may be biased. 

Consequently, if bias is entered into these algorithms, they can result in disparities in health or treatment outcomes, which could further hinder the diversity and inclusion efforts in the setting. This means certain groups of individuals could experience unfair treatment or outcomes as a result.
This could be classified as data injustice as these individuals could suffer the repercussions of these biased algorithms.

When I undertook safe researcher training, I realised that whilst I researched for the NHS and other large organisations, there was no way for me to gain access to safe research environments. If you cannot gain access to data, you cannot apply for research funding. Some funders require costly data environments to be established before grant application. When I raised data access as an equity issue to Research Data Scotland, they reflected, but then I noted that they changed the scope of their work so that work with small research organisations and individual researchers was not a part of their focus area. I also raised this to the Wellcome Trust, and they actually began the process of reflection and I believe now they allow you to put associated costs into your application and you only have to set up the environment if you were successful. For five years, Wellcome did not fund a single Black academic; I believe that data accessibility is one of many reasons why. I understand the need for safe systems, but the costs and research funding systems make doing research inaccessible for many marginalised academics. In my opinion, this creates bias in who gets to decide research focus and the questions that are asked. During COVID the questions raised by community members in an inquiry about the disproportionate impact of COVID were not in sync with the research that was funded. I think this was affected by the fact that not a single Black academic received any of the £4.3 of UKRI research funding that was allocated to look at this issue.

I have selected ‘ambiguous value’ as the feature of tenuous trust to discuss.
In my opinion, the main way the CDEI trust matrix questions could address this issue is by requiring explicit consideration and articulation of potential benefits, risks and biases in the collection and use of data and how these are going to be measured and minimised. 
Additionally, in requiring transparency over how and why these judgements have been made, trust can be built between those sharing and collecting data as it addresses some of the power imbalances when the public is unaware of how their data may be used. The trust matrix however does rely on those collecting or using data to thoroughly and honestly answer the questions it poses and report the trade offs that may be required. When considering that often private, profit driven companies are involved  that want to motivate and also profit from people sharing their personal data I would also question whether more robust requirements might also be necessary.

I think there are essential questions relating to the value of data use which were not outlined in the proposed trust matrix by the CDEI. Questions such as: 
Should the benefits of data use to the public outweigh that of the individual (data subject)? 
Who should determine the value of data use? 
I consider these questions ethical when it comes to addressing the issue of trust and trustworthiness in the use of data.

Value can be subjective, meaning it could be based on the thoughts, opinions or personal judgements of people involved. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, the names and data of the victims who had died from the virus were made available for public consumption. This means their trusted health providers shared this personal information with external authorities. Although this approach was intended to enhance public health, however, it could have been perceived as distressing or devastating to the victims and their families.

Safety Issues and Recalls:
If a pharmaceutical company experiences problems with the safety of its products, such as recalls due to adverse effects or contamination, trust in the company can quickly erode. For example, the recall of a commonly used medication due to unexpected side effects can raise concerns among healthcare professionals and patients.

However, what about if research is not a prospective endeavour e.g. using existing patient notes to train an algorithm, or undertake research analysis. This may be particularly true where external companies may be offering services for 'free' in return for using the data (not necessarily extracting it, but perhaps running it through their algorithms etc). These actual or perceived conflicts of interest can undermine trust. It is also very hard to measure public benefit and value and whether it outweighs profit (e.g. whose 'profit) and can lead to all manner of slippery slope arguments about the evidence for value, for example. The risk also tends to be left with the individual (e.g. impact of data breach or loss) and NHS organisation (as the over-arching data controller), with benefits often appearing to disproportionately accrue to the external company.

Ambiguous value is one of the features of 'tenuous trust'. One of the ways that the CDEI proposed to address this was to ensure ""there is a clear statement of the expected benefits'"". I agree that by explicitly stating the potential list of benefits, individuals will have a clearer idea of the purpose of the proposed need for data sharing. Data sharing for a general public good (e.g machine learning of large anonymised datasets of chest x-rays to create a chest x-ray computer-aided diagnosis algorithm) generally appeals to most individuals if time and effort is taken to explain the proposed aim in a clear and simple manner. This is assuming that there is minimal potential harm involved which brings us to the subsequent point. 

The CDEI proposed another solution to tackle ambiguous value by ""clearly stating how benefits, potential harms and biases will be measured"". While this statement is ideal, it may unfortunately be less realistic than we envision it to be. The statement assumes that we have full insight of all the potential benefits, harms and biases involved with the data sharing act. In the real world, there are multiple potential harms that fall into the category of 'known unknowns and unknown unknowns'. If we did attempt to make every effort to postulate all possible harms, we may fall into the trap of overcalling since all risks are 'possible' albeit at a much lower possibility. For example, despite using an anonymised dataset of chest x-ray, one can propose a farfetched possibility that data privacy may still be breached if the DICOM metadata was leaked. 
I believe that a realistic goal would be to take a measured analysis and provide reasonable plausible risks at that given time point based on the available information instead of providing a blanket statement on all possible risks.","31/01/2024, 13:24"

I work in the Northern Territory of Australia. A large proportion of our patients are aboriginal, and there are multiple factors in gaining trust. The aboriginal population has a recent history of trauma through colonisation and subsequent government decisions. 

Some illustration to the challenges, some consider the last attempted massacre of aboriginals in the NT to be in 19811. Nearly all the children in youth justice detention in the NT are aboriginal2. Aboriginals have worse health outcomes, with analysis suggesting these are 34% due to social determinants, 19% due to health risk factors, and 47% due to poor access to health services, and the impact of culture and history on health3.

Demonstrating trust has to be done in the context of the health service being part of the government. Having culturally safe communication is a start, not only by using the right language, but also through involvement of the community in any data project. This goes beyond simple consultation and marketing, and for truly culturally safe project it requires aboriginal leadership and empowerment within decision making bodies.

Often trust is eroded not because what is proposed is not in accordance with defined standards, guidance law or policy but because people do not have faith in who decides. 

For example - Mustafa Suleyman was co-founder of DeepMind Technologies, Under Suleyman, DeepMind developed research collaborations with the NHS and other healthcare organizations in the United Kingdom. In 2017, the U.K.’s data watchdog ruled that DeepMind unlawfully accessed 1.6 million NHS patient records.  In 2019 Suleyman became a member of the government's new Artificial Intelligence Council. He later became a non-exec of the UK's largest research funder UKRI, with noted conflicts of interest in 2020 when he ended this role. In March 2020 Suleyman also attended emergency COBRA Meetings on the UK's response to COVID. In 2022 Suleyman co-founded Inflection AI, which has already received 1.3 Billion in venture capital. In 2023 in response to recognition that as Artificial Intelligence for military purposes is becoming an increasingly prioritised area of Government investment (with the Integrated Review announcing at least £6.6bn for R&D), Suleyman was of few individuals who were invited to begin on a new international treaty to regulate autonomous weapons systems. 
Suleyman has spoken widely and written on the subject of ethics and AI, there is no evidence of wrongdoing but I feel that it is hard to trust individuals who are part of decision-making in so many arenas of research and data management, whilst simultaneously profiting from data and being a decision-maker on what the UK's research funding priorities should be. Positions that Suleyman holds are frequently by invite only, there are no points of application for marginalised individuals without established networks and prestige. I feel that the power held by individuals like this is too much and too opaque. 
I feel the limitation of the matrix by CEDI is that it focuses too much on asking how decisions were made, but not on who is deciding and how they were appointed. I don't just care that we consider things like how different groups are affected and what are the harms or benefits. I care about who is involved and leading consideration of this, and how they were appointed.

Most of us are willing to allow our data to be used by the public sector for public good and we trust those that are asking for access to that data.

As someone who handles patient identifiable data every day I am permanently terrified that there will be a failure in our systems resulting in a data breach. 
In over twenty years we have had two data breaches in the department. The first was a serious breach, the second human error without any obvious consequences. However, we learnt valuable lessons from both occurrences.
The first involved a senior clinician leaving an unencrypted USB containing patient identifiable in a computer in our own library. The USB was found by a member of nursing staff who opened it to try to identify the owner and realising that it had patient data on it handed it in to management. Management identified the owner and an investigation undertaken. The clinician fully accepted responsibility. They undertook training on Data Protection and Security and are now an excellent champion for the Trust's policies surrounding the handling and security of patient data. The Caldicott Guardian was informed of the breach and the clinician interview.
The second involved two patients with the same name that we were following up with questionnaires. The forms had basic demographic information including their name and data of birth. One patient called us up to tell us we had their details wrong and we realised the error. We apologised and asked them to destroy the form and we sent out a new one with the correct details. We then called the other patient and asked them to destroy the form they had received. They hadn't noticed the error but we still apologised and sent them a new form too. We now make sure that any patients with the same or even similar names are handled with great care.

Engaging Facebook users about how their data is used and share might have potentially mitigated most risks associated with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, but not all of them. Such risks include:
Data literacy will be enhanced. Data privacy laws have been established worldwide starting from mid-1990s with the EU Data Protection Directive, followed by the Data Protection Act 1998 of UK, Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) 2000 of Canada, HIPAA 1996 of USA, most users are not fully aware of their rights and responsibilities towards their personal data.
Users would have been more cautious towards what information to be shared with third-party applications.
Consent must have been needed before any act of data collection is conducted, with clear and transparent information displayed for users to acknowledge such act, how their data are used, and what benefits/disadvantages they are facing. Similar to current practices, in compliance with the EU's GDPR, cookie pop-ups (or cookie banners) are needed as an agreement between a website/app and the visitor to help him/her/them informed about any information used or tracked by third-parties.
By involving users, Facebook would have been held more accountable to ensure that the collected data are safe, secure; to mitigate any associated risk and exploitation for unethical purposes.

However, as such, such engagement is not the sole solution that can fully prevent the incidence of Cambridge Analytica to happen. There are several other causes that need to be addressed, mainly revolving around the already lenient data policy and lack of supervision on data practices of third-party applications (To urgently address this problem, in April 2018, right after the scandal, Facebook decided to implement EU's GDPR in all areas that this company operates, not just within the EU region).","19/02/2024, 16:17"

1. Lack of trust in Data Science as a field

One possible implication from controversies such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal may be a general distrust of the field or those working in it. Data Science can be incredibly powerful when used for good, but in occasions such as this scandal, it could undermine the field.

2. Targeted political advertising - can it ever be ethical?

Generally speaking, it can be near impossible to prevent any targeted advertising as a user of social media. Deliberately building an ""echo chamber"" environment to increase time spent on the platform, along with targeted advertising to sometimes extreme details, has led to a situation where two people could see completely different content, which is curated to ensure further entrenchment of the content they are being presented with. This could be unethical in a number of ways.

Campaigning through targeted advertising has been happening for hundreds of years, e.g. posters/billboards highlighting key candidate policies aligned most with the priorities of a community. Cambridge Analytica increased the individualisation of advertising, combining personal data with intimate psychometric profiles. Additionally, for a large number involved, the personal data was unknowingly shared via their Facebook friends.

The election was very close, and a large surprise for approximately half of the voters as the echo chamber of online experience and advertising had hidden how polarised political views had become.This experience caused feelings of: distrust, anger/resentment and insecurity. 

Implications experiencing this includes: unwillingness to provide information for future research, distrust of the experts, distrust in political leaders, scepticism of research institutions and fearfulness of online personal safety.

The Great Hack (2019) is a documentary about the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal that I credit as the tipping point for my leaving the marketing industry because of its discussion of the implications of what Cambridge Analytica was able to do: targeting and profiling at scale and with minimal human supervision. Target audiences and political influence are not new concepts; but delivering a psychometric test to, analyzing results on, and targeting messaging to the entire American public is not something that was previously possible - mostly from the sheer amount of labor involved. Now that the tools are available and with a low barrier to entry, it calls into question who we should allow to collect data at this magnitude, whether we as individuals are responsible for maintaining the integrity of our knowledge, and how we can implement regulatory or research frameworks onto commercial enterprises effectively running unscientific experiments.

While there are many actors in the ecosystem including financially-driven corporations, there is an unavoidable element that these users themselves hold a large stake in controlling how their data is provided/accessed. 

Users have to be vigilant and aware of what they are consenting to when they click the ""I agree"" button. Information for consent can be provided, however users must ensure they play their role in ""understanding"" that information, rather than quickly scrolling past. They should also look out for options to minimize the data they are providing, and be wary when providing sensitive health data. 

Of course, platforms and the corporations utilizing such data must also be transparent and accountable, complying to data safety standards and not funneling the data for unspecified gains (143) ","10/02/2024, 10:04"

I can see that social media users have a limited control on how these media giants can use their data. Given that the whole platforms are free, the exchange of user data for platform access is a recognized transaction. yet users can mitigate risks by judiciously managing the information they share, specifically by withholding sensitive data. Fundamentally, social media users should be empowered to exercise informed consent and control over the dissemination and utilization of their data. Furthermore, users should actively engage in advocating for robust data protection measures, privacy regulations, and ethical standards within the realm of social media. Furthermore, platform operators and policymakers should be held accountable for upholding user rights, they should show in a detailed manner how do they use the shared data.

Data controversies like Cambridge Analytica highlight the significant vulnerability of 'open data'. From a moral standpoint, we preach the importance of informed consent and personal autonomy but this does not prevent such instances from occurring again. It showcases the ugly truth that any data, as long as it is accessible via the net, is not free from exploitation. In fact we may even be misled that our data is 'protected' or 'confidential' when opting for limited access such as 'restricted sharing' when indeed this is not a foolproof protection method.

If Facebook users would have been engaged, they would have taken a decision upon the use of their data and they would have not been exploited and manipulated by Cambridge Analytica.Similar things happened with US political campaign and twitter usage. People’s behaviour was manipulated towards voting a specific candidate using people’s biases and herd behaviour. The need arises for a data ethical framework on any social media tool since it can lead to user’s data usage and their manipulation to the point that many of their choices are completely influenced by social media – for this reason consumer’s behaviour and political choices should be highly regulated and individuals should be free to opt out from their data to be taken and used to influence their choices exploiting their cognitive biases. This may sound paternalistic but vulnerable groups are the ones who are exploited the most and using their data could lead them to be more prone to even addictive behaviours. To prevent this there should be a degree of freedom since it is useful to have some of the data of our preference to be taken but the rule of law should intervene to prevent users to be exploited. So I would claim for a paternalistic intervention to ensure everyone has the same right to be responsibly giving their data and not being manipulated.","08/02/2024, 21:59"

It is interesting and probably instructive to see how Facebook developed from a community based idea with mutual benefit to one of the global social media corporations with the the power to influence our lives whether users or not.
The utility of the product often makes consumers willing to compromise on ethical concerns and privacy controls offered are not always easy to navigate.
Reuters Digital News Report1 reveals, that for news, particularly amongst younger audiences, a wider variety of apps are being used and the influence of main players X and Facebook is reducing. Users also indicate their awareness and disapproval or mistrust of algorithmic control.
However, I believe that given the complexities and the wider effects on society, the role that users can play in influencing behaviours of the social media giants is limited. I think that legal controls need to be strengthened and public education around social media use increased.

Within this construct, although not necessarily well informed, the social media users have consented to their data being used.

The social media company has an obligation to ensure it's users are informed, and this is no small task. It is not good enough to have users agree with legalese without checking they have understood. 

Consent, even when informed, should be able to be withdrawn. Social media allows this, and users may delete their accounts.

Companies have a responsibility to inform their users, and ensure users remain informed, over how their data is used. Users have no role to play in how their data is used, other than to remove their data (and their patronage) from the platform if data usage does not align with the users values.

Pawel Orzechowski,HEIN110622022-3,Code and Course Questions,indexIssue12,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"Common Questions and Answers about the assignment from your emails:

Q: How to copy-paste the long shiny links? Sometimes my link is suddenly not working when I copy-paste it to outlook or another software?
A: The links to your shiny code can be very long (tens of thousands of characters) because they include the whole dataset (unless you decided to import it via async). Watch out to not get your link 'trimmed' (shortened) by the software you use to send it. Eg, outlook has a limit of how long links can be. That's why you need to handle and submit the link via software that does not shorten links, eg. word. How to test if it worked, try to click/follow the link and see if it indeed opened correctly. Example process: in your shiny choose share button; copy the long sharing link (one on top); paste it into a word document. It will be very very long, but will work!

Q: Do I have to use interactions for the dashboard, like hovering or clicking on bars in the graphs and showing the relevant data?
A: No. It's completely not required. If it serves your purpose, feel free to include them. Many interactions are not part of the ggplot (which is easier in shiny).

Q: Is styling my dashboard needed? Like changing colours, layouts etc?
A: styling the dashboard (with CSS layout language) was not taught on this course. So feel free to do it, but explain somewhere in your code (eg. as a comment) or writeup what you did. I do it very rarely/little in my own work dashboards, because it is quite a skill for styling to improve things rather just make them more colourful. So short answer is: feel free to do it, but watchout that it does not make your dashboard harder to use.

Q: how can I make more code more DRY?
A: look for things which are repeated. Can they be extracted into functions, which you then use? In general it's more important to make your code readable and well signposted, than it is to make it short/DRY. Example: if you turn large numbers to a specific format in many places in your code (eg. 23000 to ""$23k"", 412333 to ""$412k"") you might consider creating function like   
def budget_to_dolars_k(budget): 
  just_k = int(budget/1000)
  return f""${just_k}k""

Q: Do we need to create one dashboard with 2 case studies? Or two dashboards with a case study each?
A: One dashboard only. And then you need to show it is universal enough that it can be used for two case studies","16/05/2023, 12:30"
George Zeng,HEIN110622022-3,Code and Course Questions,indexIssue9,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"Hi all,

Just in case others have similar issues as me with the extremely long sharing urls with shinylive for the assessment. I can access the starting code if I click on the hyperlink directly, but copy + pasting the url and my own application's urls does not work. I am on Windows 11 and tried Chrome and Edge. 

I think it's due to an url limit in the url bar in these browsers because Firefox seems to work with these extremely long urls.

Alternatively I've moved the raw csv online and fetch it into my application which saves a lot of file and url space. Now the url sharing with copy+paste works seamlessly in Chrome.

Could I please request an official online source/url of the raw data (OCED_simplified.csv) for the assessment? Obviously using my github link will lose the anonymity.

Feel free to use my link temporarily:

This involved reading in the data, extracting the unique HBNames and placing them in a list. This was then passed to the ui_input_*() function as a value for the 'choices=' argument.

I am wondering if there is a more sophisticated way to do this using the data uploaded by the server function rather than having to load the data separately? On a similar theme I don't really understand why the 'get _data' helper function is needed and what the @reactive.Calc decorator does?

George Zeng,HEIN110622022-3,Code and Course Questions,indexIssue5,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"Hello,

I assume the datasets for this weeks task are the new .csv files in ""week_04/data"" folder in noteable named ""ui_admissions_2022.csv"" and ""ui_deaths_2022.csv"". However using the online shinylive code editor, I cannot upload the admissions dataset into the workspace (I assume it's too big) and even using the deaths dataset is very slow when sharing the app via link generation.

Are we supposed to be using both full datasets in the online editor?

Given possible delay in reply from Pawel/Kevin as its a bank holiday weekend - for this weeks badge I've reduced both datasets to a manageable size with only the latest year to use with the online shinylive editor (attached in this post if others want to use).

Another option would be to work offline using a local IDE but this means sharing is difficult

Simon Hulme,HEIN110622022-3,Code and Course Questions,indexIssue10,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"Following this weeks lab I decided to try to impute age in a more nuanced way by using the mean age for each Sex and Pclass combination.
Challenges:
I had difficulty iterating by row - when I tried to write a for loop it seemed to iterate over columns of the dataframe. I found the .itterows() from a google search and this worked. 

The other challenge I faced as I developed this code was the need to be aware at all stages what type of data was being returned as this affected other actions such as subsetting. For example using iterrows() returned a tuple containing each passengers index as well as their data. I had to amend the for statement to account for this. for index, passenger in ... vs for passenger in ....

I had difficulty with the conditional statement to detect if Age value was missing or not. .isna() didn't work A google search resulted in using np.isnan() instead.

Could you please check this code for me and give feedback as to any ways it could be improved. I am considering developing it further to use with map() so I can iterate over rows to create the new column for imputed ages.
Code:
# function to impute ages based on class and sex
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
 
passengers = pd.read_csv('./data/titanic_kaggle_train.csv')
 
def impute_ages(data):
    '''
    This input for this function is the 'Titanic' dataset from kaggle.com.
    The output is a list of imputed values for Age with missing values replaced by the
    mean age for the Sex and Pclass of each passenger.
    '''  
    # calculate grouped mean age by sex and pclass
    age_class_sex = passengers.groupby(['Pclass', 'Sex'])['Age'].agg(np.mean)
    # create list as a container for new values
    new_values = []
    # iterate across rows of the data frame ie. by passenger
    for index, passenger in data.iterrows():
            # identify if Age missing for each passenger
            if np.isnan(passenger['Age']):
                # extract value of mean age according to PClass and Sex
                returned_value = age_class_sex.loc[passenger['Pclass'], passenger['Sex']]
                new_values.append(round(returned_value, 2))
            else:
                # return 'Age' if no missing value
                new_values.append(passenger['Age'])
    return new_values    
 
# create new column for imputed values
passengers['Age_imputed'] = impute_ages(passengers)
 
# check if imputation correct
# print table of mean values grouped by PClass and Sex
print(passengers.groupby(['Pclass', 'Sex'])['Age'].agg([np.mean]))
print()
# print example of each imputed value ﻿
passengers_age_na = passengers[passengers['Age'].isna()].loc[:, ['Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'Age_imputed']]

{UPDATE: I figured it out - the dropdown selections are defaulted to str and the year needed to be cast to an int otherwise it wasn't finding a match in the dataset. I'll leave this up in case anyone runs into a similar issue)

I've run into an issue with producing a plot for my dashboard. I worked it out on the Jupyter notebook and it works fine and Shiny isn't giving me any errors (aside from ""Unhandled error: can't start new thread""; but I saw previously on this thread that, that shouldn't actually impact the dashboard function), but my plot isn't being rendered. It's just a grey square with a title. I've been trying to hunt down answers online, but I can't find anything.

This is my code for generating a plot and the rendering of the plot. Since I'm using Plotly for reactivity, I'm using render_widget.

The title using f-string is updating correctly, so I know the generate plot function is getting the correct data and reacting, but for some reason, no bar charts are produced and the countries don't appear on the x-axis either. This is what it looks like:

In your code you can limit the dataset to any number of countries, years or measures.

Ask yourself: Do I completely understand this code? Could I have written this code? Could I explain this code to someone who does not understand it?
Decide whether your understanding is at level (score is the number in brackets)
⛔️ (0) - I don't understand it
✅ (1) - I get the simplest examples only
⭐️ (2) - I get it and could have written this code myself
🔥 (3) - I could explain subtle differences and intricacies of this code to someone

In this short post I would like you to share two things:
Average of your 'self test' points for all 12 intro badges. For example if you answered ""(2) - I get it and could have written this code myself"" 8 badges (that's 8 x 2 points) and ""(1) I get the simplest examples only"" to 3 badges (that's 3 x 1 point), and ""I don't understand it"" to 1 badge (1 x 0 points), then your average would be 1.6. It's ok if this number is a bit of a guess, no need to be super accurate.
intro-badges which you feel least comfortable with (which we might recap on week 1 live session) - write badge names or even just badge numbers

Answer A:

For age groups 0-64 years, males consistently have higher admissions compared to females.
The trend changes as we reach the older age groups, for the ages 65+ females have higher admissions compared to males.

The data is grouped by council areas to sum the number of deaths due to unintentional injuries. The council area with the highest number of deaths due to unintentional injuries is Glasgow City.

This could be due to its large population and high urban density, which might contribute to higher accident rates. Socio-economic factors, public health infrastructure, and access to emergency services could also influence the rates of unintentional injuries and subsequent deaths. Further investigation into the specific causes and demographics of these incidents within Glasgow City could provide deeper insights into targeted prevention strategies.


Q2: What is the trend in the number of admissions over the years?

# Group data by FinancialYear and sum the NumberOfAdmissions
admissions_per_year = admissions_df.groupby('FinancialYear')['NumberOfAdmissions'].sum().reset_index()
 
 
# Plot trend

plt.xlabel('Financial Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Admissions')
plt.grid(True)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
 



The trend in admissions shows a clear peak in 2019/20, with a significant drop in 2020/21, likely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic may have led to reduced hospital admissions as people avoided hospitals, and many non-urgent medical procedures were postponed. The partial recovery in 2021/22 indicates a return to normalcy, though the drop in 2022/23 suggests that the healthcare system and patient behaviour might still be adjusting post-pandemic. This analysis underscores the significant impact of external events, like the pandemic, on healthcare utilisation patterns.","06/06/2024, 16:13"

*The idea of how to save and share code on shiny-- I do feel that if I were to use it beyond the scope of the course it would be much easier to have a desktop setup that would make it easier.

? Definitely very new to me-- but I like the fact that I can see a physical output. Looking forward to working with Shiny more to understand where its differences lie and what is possible.","12/06/2024, 11:43"

Matt Bouamrane,HEIN110632023-4,Hello and welcome to the course,indexIssue11,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"Hello and Happy New Year everyone!

 I hope you've all had a good winter break and are now ready to 'tuck in' the Evaluating Digital Transformation course.

It is really nice to hear about your different backgrounds and experiences and your motivations for learning more about this course. 

Evaluation is clearly relevant to all disciplines and in a variety of contexts so hopefully that message should appear clearly in the lectures material as we progress throughout the course.

For week 1, after defining some key concepts and definitions of evaluation, I have chosen to review 3 case studies in more depth, the National Programme for IT in NHS England (NPfIT), the Scotland Telecare Development programme and the Whole System Demonstrator. 

-   The NPfIT remains to date the largest civilian IT programme to date and although it had some relative and modest achievements, it is generally considered an unmitigated failure. 
NPfIT is in part responsible for a move away from extremely large national top down transformation programmes, in part because NPfIT demonstrated that this type of programmes are too complex, too expensive, impossible to manage and deliver solutions that are anything but fit for purpose. It is important that we remember these lessons today lest we be tempted to emulate something similar. 

-   The Scotland Telecare Development programme (TDP) and the Whole System Demonstrator (WSD) are completely different yet contemporaneous programmes to NPfIT (e.g. mid 2000s to mid 2010s) and were selected to provide different perspectives. The Scotland TDP was also a national programme yet it was bottom up: funding was made available to regional and organisational stakeholders to develop telecare solutions and services that suited local initiatives and priorities. This also provides some clear challenges for evaluation as it becomes difficult to keep track of all the interventions taking place as part of the programme and how to objectively evaluate what may be very different and heterogeneous sets of activities and services, 

-   As for the WSD, it remains one of the largest randomised control trial (RCT) of telehealth and telecare technologies in the world to date, yet in my lecture, I also discuss the limitations of using such a rigid and lengthy evaluation study design for large scale digital transformation programmes as it also showed it lacked the flexibility to adapt the intervention to local needs and priorities.

Those 3 case studies sets the scene for the next content of the course it terms of highlighting the importance of clearly defining evaluation aims and objectives (week 2) from the outset as well as carefully selecting appropriate evaluation frameworks, theories and methods for evaluation (week 2 - 6)

I hope you enjoy these lectures and the related live sessions and I am really looking forward to working with you over the next 10 weeks.","08/01/2024, 10:08"

Proposed intervention context
Digitalisation of ONS prescriptions by Dietetics. 
ONS are added to Hepma in hospital by Dietitian, rather than written in paper cardex and countersigned by medical team.

It is not documented what difference digitalisation hoped to bring, however Hepma may reduce risk ( for staff and patients) improve efficiency ( time savings) and ultimately promote clinically cost effective prescribing of ONS

I am evaluating whether Hepma has supported clinically cost effective prescribing of ONS. 

I'm concerned though that there is very little data i can readily access to evidence the objectives that would be needed to underpin the above aim and my evaluation plan.

I am involved in a very small project which is looking at using Connect Me text messaging and Near Me video calling with patients waiting for physiotherapy in the community (ie in their homes). Our waiting times are longer than we would like and the patients who are waiting are elderly and at risk of falls/deconditioning/increased fear of movement due to pain and so on. 

We tried Near Me video consultations during the pandemic but it did not work well due to issues including technical (wifi / connection), lack of confidence/competence with technology by the patients themselves, and perceived risk as well as practical difficulties of carrying out what is usually a physical hands on / functional assessment via video call. 

This project would involve texting patients on the routine waiting list to remind and reassure them they are on the list and to ask how their symptoms are - improved, the same, or worse. 

Depending on the reply they could receive further messages directing them to online self management or other relevant community services, if appropriate; even asking if they want to be removed from the list if improved, or offering a phone or video consultation if they are worse. 

The goals would be to optimise the management of the waiting list, reduce risk for patients while awaiting treatment, reduce complaints or phone calls asking when they will be seen, improve efficiency by reducing staff travel time.

I have previously used a survey method in my physiotherapy hons dissertation so I would be comfortable using that again 

Should choice of evaluation methods be predicated on which ones you feel more comfortable using or the initial evaluation aim and objectives?
I think theoretically, the methods definitely need to be based on the evaluation aim and objectives. In real life though, as a clinician who hasn't got a lot of experience in research and evaluation (yet!) it will be a bit 'hit or miss' - the person choosing the methods needs to know about the relevant types of methods and what they are appropriate for before they can choose to use them. And there appears to be a huge number of different methods, different types, appropriate for different things. So it will be a combination of 'comfortable with' and 'initial aim/objectives'

if there was an AI or computer programme where you could enter your evaluation aim, objectives and be provided with a range of appropriate and suitable methods....! 

I am planning a feasibility (pre-implementation) evaluation on the use of Connect Me text messaging for managing a community physio waiting list. Patients on the list are elderly with multimorbidities. Possible issues around the patients' engagement with the text messaging (as per NASSS and pre-mortem - previous assignment) so I thought about using the Technology Acceptance Model and the TPOM evaluation framework. 
There seem to be so many options for objectives under the aim (evaluate feasibility) though that I am not sure how to choose which to focus on. ","21/02/2024, 16:27"

What is your understanding of the differences between an evaluation framework and an evaluation theory? 
I think an evaluation framework is a practical tool that helps guide us through an evaluation process. As it is mainly standardised it allows for comparison. Frameworks provide a consistent set of guidelines . A framework can be used before during or after programmes/projects. There are many to choose from and you need to base your decision of using one which will be able to evaluate the main aim of the project. 
An evaluation theory provides a conceptual framework for designing or understanding an evaluation. It can look at a variety of reasons for adoption and non adoption -socio-technically- people, service, organisation. They can help evaluators to determine what the appropriate methods, techniques and approaches to use during an evaluation. 
How are these potentially complementary to one another? 
They can , if used together, provide practical guidance and an overarching conceptual understanding for an evaluation. 
What in your opinion is the value (or otherwise) of using a theory to underpin a programme evaluation? 
I think it helps us to identify the reasons for the results from the evaluation process.","10/02/2024, 15:00"
https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-017-0605-9,HEIN110632023-4,💬 Week 5 Discussion: Frameworks versus theories,indexIssue8,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"I have used theories and frameworks in the design of an intervention before - I used the ""theoretical domains framework"" (which is a framework constructed from 33 theories of behavioural change) to design an intervention that was intended to cause behavioral change: https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-017-0605-9
So - this is the first time I have considered theories and frameworks coming out the other end - i.e. in evaluation, not in design. 

The TDF for designing interventions has helped me understand the difference between an evaluation theory and an evaluation framework because there is something empirical (or theoretical) about what a theory and a framework are that is universal and so can be applied here – the theory of what a theory and a framework are, if you will. 

Infact – “The theory of planned behavior” was one of the key source theories for construction of the TDF AND is one of the theories covered this week related to evaluation of digital transformation. 
Why is a theory used to inform behavioral intervention development also a key theory in evaluating digital transformation? 

I think this illustrates the point perfectly: Theories (evaluation theory or not) are fundamental constructs describing universal truths that can help us build situation specific frameworks and understand phenomena occurring in different settings. Frameworks are like a tool kit – suited to certain tasks and situations, built up from theories. 

What is my opinion about using a theory to underpin programme evaluation? 
In that respect, it may not be necessary to “select” a theory to underpin a programme evaluation and may even be counter productive, since most sound frameworks should be built on theoretical foundations, and usually draw on multiple theories. However, a broad understanding of relevant theories is likely to help a leader predict and interpret programme events and team/ participant behavior before it happens, and to explain why certain things happened when it comes to evaluating.

From what I learned I believe the framework provides steps to work through as a project or implementation progresses. Ideally one should be applied prior to starting. There is likely not to be one that’s fits perfectly hence there are lots of frameworks to choose from. Evaluation theory on the other hand is evidence based and provides a scientific explanation of people’s reactions, feelings, behaviours to change. I believe you require to understand and utilise both when evaluating a project. Without the theory the framework could easily become a tick box exercise that doesn’t provide reasons for success or failure. Would like feedback on this as unsure if on the right track of thinking!

The framework provides the structure for the evaluation outlining the elements that should be considered in the evaluation whereas the theory underpins the why and how the elements have an impact.

The framework can provide the practical tools to evaluate the aims and outcomes whereas the theory can help understand why these may have occurred?

Evaluation theory / theories can be used within framework to help make sense of specific elements

What in your opinion is the value (or otherwise) of using a theory to underpin a programme evaluation? 

The use of a theory helps to describe and understand the sociotechnical elements of change and their impact on the ability to deliver the desired outcomes. It helps to understand why things have gone well or not - and potentially why similar implementations have different outcomes in different contexts. It helps to understand the reasons for this and therefore will help others to adjust implementation plans based on what is consider critical to success.","07/02/2024, 16:20"

 What is your understanding of the differences between an evaluation framework and an evaluation theory? 
An evaluation framework is a process to support the implementation and monitoring of (in this case) a digital transformation to ensure that outcomes and impacts can be evidenced and reported. It allows complexity and challenges to be proactively identified and where possible minimised. 
An evaluation theory may inform how you carry out the evaluation and support explaining how you might achieve specific results. They can help identify underlying assumptions and practices. 

How are these potentially complementary to one another? 
Frameworks can provide the step-by-step guide and practical tools, while the theories can provide the theoretical concepts, which together can support the development of a robust evaluation process. 

What in your opinion is the value (or otherwise) of using a theory to underpin a programme evaluation? 
At the moment I am struggling to process how I would use both in practice, this may be as they are all very new and little overwhelming trying to consider so much at once.

Why do you think this is the case?

Lack of resources, Social care organisations often work to very tight budgets and often don't have necessary resources, or expertise. They often have to prioritise care delivery over technological programme evaluations. There is much advancement in the sector. In my own organisation we are currently undertaking technology replacements in the areas of community alarm, equipment and adaptation system, care management system and a scheduling system. 
Complex stakeholder landscape- Social care is complex and there are multiple stakeholders including service users, carers, health colleagues, regulatory agencies such as care inspectorate, care providers, third sector agencies, government agencies, social work, non social work council such as education, welfare rights. Each stakeholder group is often working in a silo and may have divergent interests and requirements. 
Data Privacy and Security- complex data privacy issues, sharing information can be challenging particularly when integrating with health
Fragmented systems and processes- often legacy systems frequently working in soles even within the one sector e.g. social work can have a care management system, self assessment system, benefit system, community alarm system which do not communicate with each other never mind with education systems or housing systems all within a council. Lack of interoperability between social work system and care providers ,housing providers- who all have their own different systems, 
Change management challenges- while there are frequent challenges around resourcing and reprioritising care delivery it is very difficult to introduce significant digital transformation and evaluation. 


What potential benefits would a social care specific digital transformation framework bring to the science of digital transformation evaluation? 
Standardisation- a standardised approach to evaluation in social care sector. Helping us to ensure consistency and comparability across this complex landscape. It would enhance learning Nationally and allow for benchmarking and sharing of best practice but also of reasons for failure. Increasingly we are using a social work framework of the Human Learning System.
Social Care Contextualisation- a framework specifically tailored to social care would be wonderful and we wouldn't need to try and shoehorn into theories which have been predominantly built and tested in healthcare systems. A framework tailored to social care could much better take account of our unique challenges and requirements.
Measurement of Impact- a socio technical framework could help social care identify how digital transformation projects are improving social care services and delivery of these services. Ultimately showing how services have been improved( or otherwise) for service users and communities. 
Continuous Improvement- A socio technical framework would allow for continuous improvements and would support the Human Learning System which is being adopted across social social care. A standardised framework would prompt collaboration across complex systems by providing common language and approach for evaluation. This would in turn allow for better learning from each other.
Evidenced Based Practice- a structured evaluation process with clear metrics and performance indicators could enable social care organisations make informed decisions ( from data and insights) on the effectiveness( or otherwise) of digital transformation programmes/ projects which then could inform local strategy, 


What would it take for this to happen? 
Resourcing; Increased investment in social care technology innovation and evaluation 
Leadership Development; in area of Digital transformation and importance of evaluation. I think this course is a step in the right direction. However, much more social care, particular social work representation on this type of Course is essential should we want improvements in the social care sector. 
National support- If there was a National focus on social care digital projects and evaluation with adequate resourcing to support I am sure there would be buy in from the social work sector.
Existing Framework Testing - if we started with TPOM or NASSS in social care and the frameworks themselves could be properly evaluated to ensure a fit in social care. ","10/02/2024, 15:55"

Gavin Venters,HEIN110632023-4,💬 Week 4 Discussion: Frameworks across health AND social care,indexIssue17,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"Why do you think this is the case? 
Broader economic factors - Healthcare is the richer counsin. It has much higher levels of investment local, national and global scale. Projects and programmes are typically at a larger scale as there are structures operating at regional and international levels - these have encouraged the idea that larger programmes can be imlpemented at scale. The larger scale and frequency of these programmes have made evaluation frameworks more economically necessary (and viable). Social care has had to compete with other local authority priorities wheras health authorities have a more unified focus.
Political factors - Healthcare has more ""political capital"" for policy makers, health digital companies have more lobbying power, clinicials are politically powerful and the academic sector ihas been and is, more healthcare focused. Where healthcare has been seen as a universal need, social care has been seen as a need of the needy not a policy priority of governments uninterested in social inequalities. 
Cultural factors - evidence-based and data-based practice has been a feature of the health care realm for a longer time and is embedded in things like clinical networks. Evidence-based practice is comparitively less integral to social care reducing the demand and capacity for use evaluation framework. 
Technology - the lack of national technology programmes specifically aimed at social care at scale, the lack of availability of commercial suppliers specialising in social care systems, a fragmented landscape resulting in lack of large scale digitalisation and digital transformation initiatives. 

What potential benefits would a social care specific digital transformation framework bring to the science of digital transformation evaluation? 
It would allow for digital transformation to be understood and handled in a wider range of settngs and would extend the ""people"" part of health realted frameworks beyond ""patients"" and more into the population at large.
It would improve being able to evaluate DT in the social care setting forward and make comparisons across different programmes more meaningful, and insights withing programmes richer.

What would it take for this to happen?
Funding of the necessary research, political will and prioritisation. 
Convergence and collaboration across social care organisations.
I think that the current policy agenda intertwining health and social care will be useful in the longer-term.

Could the NASSS-CAT short, be used as a pre mortem tool? 

A simplistic view but without clear digital leadership/ vision, realistic investment/ timescales, the significant challenge is probably at the outset, i.e bringing the right stakeholders across the 7 domains together. Limited skills/knowledge can be implementation barriers, even if all stakeholders are represented. 

At a local level, roll out of national digital transformation solutions (e.g Near Me /AHPs) are rarely simple. I would speculate they are complicated or complex across the 7 domains. 

 E.g
Condition- data on service users is not always accessible or utilised.
Tech- knowledge, training, resource to support and embed implementation is not always accessible
Cost effectiveness of an intervention or return on investment for training staff, purchasing required tech etc, is often contentious, especially if clear benchmarks/KPIs were not in the business case
Adopter system- health inequalities and levels of health literacy would suggest this will always be complicated
Organisation
Wider system-
Embedding and adaption over time- collective reflection, e.g the use of pre-mortem/ project management tools such as lesson learned are not always widely valued","29/01/2024, 20:28"

Simple: 3B: The value proposition was simple in that the EPR would provide one system to record all necessary information (from previous use of multiple different systems). This was more efficient for staff.

Complicated
1C - the service itself was evolving and not yet fully defined so the socio-cultural factors were complicated.
2C- although the technology was off the shelf lots of customisation was required to fit the team model and significant amounts of training were required for some staff groups.
4A - Existing staff were changing roles, though this was not due to the technology rather the fact the team was new and evolving, but this impacted on the technology they were expected to use and the learning of new skills.
5A/E- 2 partner organisations were involved with new infrastructure and although there was a shared vision at a strategic level this did not always appear the case at operational levels.. 
7A: although there is scope for evolving the technology solution there are barriers, - who will lead on it for one.

Simple
We were focused to a specific disease a cohort of patients that I knew well, I also knew the medical literature related to the disease and care pathways - I had domain knowledge so 1A - the nature of the condition or illness was simple. I can imagine leading digital transformation where the leader is not well acquainted with the disease area could pose challenges.

Complicated
3A: The value proposition. We felt that the business case provided by openEHR suppliers was under-developed, and proposition to fund bespoke development even less so. The risk of open software procurement was seen to be that in-house development and maintenance costs were unknown - we couldn't reliably predict these. It is hard to determine how that outweighs a full-stack procurement strategy in terms of cost. 
This is not insurmountable - we can learn from early adopters elsewhere in the world and gain estimates of in-house costs from them. We can adopt an iterative approach with interim evaluations without huge sunk costs - the benefit of open software - costs to pilot and test are low, investment can come in steps with evidence provided at each stage. 
This makes it complicated though - we never know for sure if we are going to progress to the next stage and be able to achieve our goals with the current approach. 

Complex
We tried to take an open data / open source / vendor neutral approach to development with a view to using openEHR architecture to support the transformation. This has/ is leading to complexity: For question 2D, although the openEHR model with vendor neutrality means we are not vulnerable to supplier withdrawal, it does mean that medium to large scale bespoke solutions are needed. This is because the supplier market for openEHR applications is immature and significant in-house development would be needed. The framework for which is still developing critical questions about who, how and with what funding would do the work pose challenges as well as questions about long term strategy and dove tailing with existing, non-openEHR programmes.
The adoption and funding decision in section 5C is also complicated - we are taking a national approach. This means the stakeholder landscape is vast. All aspects mentioned in 5c: Complex are directly relevant. 
Solutions include increasing project management staff time and careful and regular engagement with relevant policy teams and national interest groups. ","22/01/2024, 19:38"

It was difficult for staff to engage with the training if they didn't see the point of bringing in the system or it made their jobs slower (particularly with call centre sales staff on commission for the highest number of orders processed in a specific timeframe).

Where the digital solutions being implemented are more limited - to one process, rather than multiple - then it can be easier to have clear objectives which are straightforward to understand.

Yes. Aims and objectives are normally included in our project initiation document and project mandate. Also included in these documents are expected measurable benefits and project deliverables. 

The aims and objectives are further explained and strengthened in the project business case. 

Clarity of purpose was achieved by consulting with project stakeholders, customers and users. For example in an Order Comms project (the process of ordering diagnostics tests electronically) Primary Care, biochemistry, haematology and microbiology were consulted to understand their project intentions expected benefits. 

By consulting early on it gave customers ownership and a clear understanding of the project aims. We also achieved clarity of purpose by having an effective reporting and governance structure in place. For example at a Project Board the Senior Service User could remind users of the project objectives.

In hindsight, most decision are politically and financially motivated even though the use of TEC would benefit patient health and well-being, the implementation failed to critically analyse the needs, criteria for use, duration, staffing capacity to use system hence the project failed partly and also lacked sustainability when the staff responsible for implementation moved to a new post. Most project are evaluated are the end of the project cycle making it difficult to make adjustments with stakeholders that were not technically on-board from the on-set.

Moreso, introduction to system change especially technology meets resistance, organisational policies in the public sector gives staff too much leverage that allows staff to ""block"" organisational visions of changes and improvements in terms of employer and employee relationship.","09/01/2024, 04:48"

Emma Scatterty,HEIN110632023-4,💬 Week 1 Discussion: Evaluation in your organisation,indexIssue2,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"I was previously in an organisation which introduced tablets to its customers including bespoke software to enable easy access to the internet as well as information about their care. A key part of the implementation was communicating the benefits of this for service users and we found that one of the most important (if not the most important) stakeholder groups were the care staff as they would have that daily contact with service users where there would be most opportunity to talk about and demonstrate the benefits. In addition, service users trusted their carers and their voice could therefore be much more effective than corporate communications. 

I was responsible for the staff training on the new system and a large part of this was focused on understanding the benefits for service users and why we were doing what we were doing (as opposed to a much smaller aspect looking at the technical bits they had to know for their role). This included building understanding around inputs, outputs and outcomes with outcomes being the key area of interest. i.e. the technology meant a service user could now do X (e.g. do their banking online, access NHS24 information online), but the outcome of that could be much more substantial and potentially lifechanging e.g. improved wellbeing, improved financial security. This was the most challenging aspect of the training (the technical stuff was often straightforward comparatively) and it had land in order to increase usage and uptake amongst service users.

Daidre Rowe,HEIN110682023-4,W1: Good and Bad File Management Discussion,indexIssue5,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"Hello,

My group experience was in writing a manuscript for a journal article. Each person was responsible for drafting one section, in preparation for the weekly research meeting. We used Google Drive and I think that went very well because all the edits were recorded, including who made the change and when. Also, the Word document was open during meetings and edits being done would reflect on everyone's screen in real time.

Working with the same group on another manuscript, there was an awfully confusing time when persons would email versions of a document after they had worked on a section. I felt then that we had regressed tremendously. It is only now that I am writing this reflection about that time, that I realise just how unhappy I was with that turn of events.

Converting strings into categorical variables can sometimes also show up issues with inconsistencies in the way categories have been collected (e.g. entering ""high"" as multiple variants ""high"", ""High"", ""HIGH"").

In modelling, entering a (ordinal) categorical/factor variable as a numeric predictor will result in the model fitting a trend amongst the categories (1 beta estimate), when one would want to estimate the variation in the outcome across the categories relative to the referent category (n-1 of the number of levels in the categorical variable beta estimates) - there might be times when one wants the former, but most likely if you fit the former model, it was in error when handling the data type","18/04/2024, 18:09"

I think that data types play a role in navigating the data life cycle when it comes to data sharing. In sharing the data, the data type would determine the information that can be obtained/released/published. For example, if data were collected as binary ""yes"" ,""no"" for the variable called high blood pressure, then it will not be possible to share information on categories of high blood pressure. For information on these categories, which would represent severity, integers would be required. So then, at the data creation stage it is useful to anticipate the information that is required at the sharing stage, so that the appropriate data type can be selected to effectively navigate the cycle.","17/04/2024, 09:02"

For example, only allowing numeric values for vital sign entries avoids some typos and allows for cleaner data entry during the data creation and storage step.

Understanding what type of data you want to collect and the type of analysis you intend to perform, is essential during the setting up of the database, and only allowing the entry of specific data types in certain fields can reduce time spent cleaning the data later.

Another way I have seen databases attempt to improve data collection is by pre-specifying categories instead of allowing free-text inputs. For example, when collecting the indication for prescribed medication, using codes that refer to specific categories of medication e.g. 1 = antihypertensive, 2 = antibiotic, etc. This allows for the data type to be a factor instead of allowing free text, or strings.","16/04/2024, 19:05"

For example, I might be interested in explaining the probability of a disease/condition at a group (herd) level outcome against a putative predictor that has been collected as a continuous variable. Fitting the model with the raw numeric data will assess whether there is a linear relationship between odds of condition against unit increases in the predictor. But I may categorise this predictor by n-levels, refit the model, and assess whether that linearity assumption is good - perhaps there are non-linear relationships. Visualising this relationship may show that most variation may be found across a fixed threshold, and a parsimonious model may benefit from dichotomising this variable around this threshold [though recognising that a lot of information would be lost in the process!].","19/04/2024, 16:31"

Duration of exposure is a number that could be represented as a numeric data type. I will use number to mean count data, for example number of hours of screen time per day, length of hospital stay counted as number of days. In python, I would select unsigned 32-bit NumPy integer; in R, I would select integer.

This count data could be aggregated into categories using cut-offs that are meaningful. For example, studies associate overweight in adulthood with >2 hours screen time on weekdays during childhood. Length of hospital stay can be defined as prolonged at 14 days, 21 days or 30 days depending on the context. So again here, the count data could be categorised based on a meaningful cut-off value. In each case, the categories would be ordinal. In python categorical data is treated as not ordered, by default. In R, I would need to use c(""ordered"", ""factor"").

Count data could also be represented as boolean. One scenario could be where stroke patients are ineligible for clot-dissolving medication when 4.5 hours have past since their stroke symptoms began. The variable could be ""4.5_hrs_lnw"" and the inputs could be TRUE, FALSE. (lnw means last known well)

I could make detail_the_doctor_needs_for_each_person into an index so that date=0, langauge=1 pulse=2 weight=3 . The answers_provided are of different data types. The data types are date, category, integer and float. The answers_provided_by_paris is a list because it has different data types that all pertain to the person named Paris. Another feature of the list is that it changes. For example, Paris' list will change at the next checkup, in that the date will be different and the pulse will be different.

If I wanted to translate the list for the person named Paris and the person named Madrid into python coding language, I could write:

list_of_details_for_paris [ '2023-10-15', 'french', 65, 55.4]

My understanding is that an array would be like creating a record of everyone's favourite fruit in this class. I would need to give everyone a unique number. Then, I would write each person's favourite fruit beside his/her unique number:

0
apple

2

In this case, the unique numbers, all together, are termed the index. The individual fruit names are all of the same data type, in that they are all strings.

If I wanted to translate this data into the python coding language, I could write:
np.array(['apple', 'peach', 'mango', 'plum'])

OR

pd.Series(['apple', 'peach', 'mango', 'plum'])

It has been really helpful reading the comments so far to see if I have understood the content correctly and I hope more people will post their experiences to support others learning. I look forward to hearing feedback on my example below, thank you.
 Context
I was a clinician working in an acute site when there was the roll out of electronic patient records and the introduction of mandatory data collection through this system. I was a Trak Champion and support the local roll-out before chairing the Trak Champion network, becoming a key source of clinical support for others as this was further rolled out. 
Scope
Implement Electronic Patient Record through TrakCare (Intersystems).
Challenges
Time for clinical staff to learn and feel confident in new system, initially during this learning period the improvements in efficient working practices were not felt.
Access to computers to completed interventions in a timely manner, all staff wanting to access limited computers at start of day / before & after lunch / end of day.
To support clinician buy-in, there was the development of Trak Champions who were clinicians working in the clinical areas and were provided with Trak training and able to support clinicians on the ground during roll-out. 
The flexibility build into the data collection element of this resulted in huge variation in how data was inputted and thus limited comparability. 
Outcomes
EPR is now integral to how we deliver our services and provide care. 
Data can now be reported to describe activity and demand on AHP services (health) through Business Objects, although limited access to analytic support to develop reports. 
Reduced storage requirements for paper notes. 
Trak Champions led by an AHP Informatics Lead developed minimum local dataset to successfully reduce data variations. 
Enhanced digital skills of workforce. ","02/10/2023, 06:11"

In 2017 I supported the role out of BadgerNet EPR in Grampian maternity service. At that time BadgerNet was a discrete system that we used to document care provided to women during pregnancy. Records within the system could be accessed by NHS Grampian and two other boards which was required due to our cross boundary service provision. There is a limited interface with Trak which pulls through demographics and Admission, Transfer and Discharge data. 

Scope
The system has evolved into a single pregnancy record (SPR) across Scotland (with the exception of Lothian) meaning when the woman presents anywhere (almost) in Scotland her record can be viewed and written into. Data is pulled directly from the system and sent to PHS and researchers, work is being done on feeding vaccination data into the system from the Turas vaccination tool. 
We have linked our CTG (Cardio-Toco Graph) machines to the system which means that a a recording of the baby’s heart beat can be viewed remotely. There is a patient facing app that allows access to some of the content of the record. There are many more features that can be introduced but we don’t currently have a strategy to guide us on where we go from here. I would say that BadgerNet has developed into a H&CII.

Challenges 
staff resistance to implementation 
lack of equipment that was fit for purpose
system changes which dont always fit in with our process and policies
Lack of exchange of information between BadgerNet and our installed base Trak. There is excellent access to the maternity SPR across Scotland but we havent cracked it yet within our own board. 

Outcomes of implementation 
system integral to how provide and review care and it is 'invisible except on breakdown' as referred to earlier in course content. 
care better informed e.g. staff can see full record during a triage call or a review of a CTG that is taking place remotely.
Reduced storage requirements for records, easier access to records regarding previous pregnancies (since 2017)
Referrals sent from within the EPR, reports and notifications sent to GPs
Excellent access to data via Business Intelligence that is being used to shape service development 
Even staff resistant to implementation now say they would not want to go back to paper.","29/09/2023, 13:23"

At present it’s only been rolled out in early adopter sites. clinicians ' and IT have worked together very closely. It’s been a huge effort and a success in the sites. The challenge now will be to scale up and roll out to the rest of a very large estate. Business continuity has not yet been fully solved I.e. what happens if the power goes? First attempts lead to entire sets of case notes being printed - way too much paper and time! Unfortunately cost is also impacting. Mainly on having enough facilitators to get it right in each area for a safe roll out. I’m really hoping it goes to plan as I know what a shared record can do to improve pt outcomes. ,"27/09/2023, 19:41"

I was the clinical lead in a project to implement Morse as a full patient management and data gathering system. I was not part of the clinical team as my 'day job' and it was not my area of clinical expertise. 

Scope: 
Implement Morse EPR in a community CAMHS team, replacing 2 record keeping systems with one. 

Challenges: 
This was a project that the clinical team were told was necessary to improve their data - so getting clinical users from the team on board to commit to confirming processes and to protecting time for thorough end to end testing was challenging. 
As the system is very flexible allowing you to achieve the same goal in different ways eg add an appointment in different ways, staff found their own ways to do things once the system went live, but weren't aware of the impact of shortcuts in using the system. 
Due to lack of capacity in the IT team some of the functionality of the system, is still not in use locally and would be of benefit to clinical staff. Staff still need to rely on other systems for certain clinical info. 
Information services team weren't familiar with the system so data extraction has been a work in progress and data quality issues have highlighted issues with staff using the system in a different way than taught!
How to ensure the clinical team voice in improving the system is heard as the 'project team' move to the next team.

Outcomes: Morse was rolled out and all CAMHS staff now use this as the primary method of managing referrals, waiting lists, appointments and note keeping. Staff can now access on ipads or desktop. 

Learning: 
Clinical ownership is vital and ensuring the clinical voices involved in the project are there because they want to rather than being told to. 
Flexibility in the software system is a positive and a negative! Has let to different people doing different things resulting in data quality issues.
As a project team, ensure you grow expertise in the clinical team to ensure they can continue to develop the system when the project team moves on. ","27/09/2023, 12:52"

The objective of the project I managed was to upgrade the existing NHS Lothian TrakCare T2016 application and related services (interfaces, printing, reports including Business Intelligence) to T2020 within the project time frame and with minimal disruption to the service and users. Timeframe: starting May 2020 with implementation November 2020 and project closure January 2021.

Scope:
·Functionally equivalent upgrade i.e. pre- and post-upgrade functionality (including interfaces printing and reporting) will be equivalent with the exception of functionality outlined in the Obligatory Enhancements, Deprecated Items, Non Backwards Compatible documentation or changes required to assist with issue resolution.
·System environments required to support the project and the agreed test strategy.
·Desktop changes required by the T2020 Client Machine Standard Operating Environment.

Challenges:
·The effort required to implement increased considerably when, during the project, supplier confirmed that a piece of “deprecated” functionality (RTF Editor – used for Clinical Notes & Radiology Reports) had to be replaced to be able to upgrade to Trakcare T2020.
·Compared to the previous upgrade Lothian had to make a higher number of changes to address issues; a major reason for this is due to the fact that Lothian’s version of Trakcare, with our extensive configuration and development, differs from the standard version of the system (“Scottish Edition”). 

Outcomes:
·The project kept to its original plan by getting T2020 live in 2020.
·During July the project scope was changed to include the replacement of deprecated RTF functionality by HTML functionality, and the replacement of Toolkit by .Net functionality. Although this had a significant change to the scope of the project it was still Lothian’s intention to meet the objective of getting the project live in 2020.
·During October the project approach was revised to include incorporation of the suppliers Maintenance Releases MR2 – MR4 as the basis for delivery of fixes. Whilst these provided the best basis for taking the project forward they introduced several hundred software changes not requested by Lothian and required Lothian to take on significant additional testing.

Context: Implementation of a national cloud-relational database environment / data capture application 

Scope: Application provided by Public Health Scotland with diverse use cases for health and social care to capture data about staff and citizens within defined projects. National scope. 

Challenges: 
Inter-organisational collaboration and role defintions - dual development undertaken by NSS-DaS/ PHS

Defining specification and requirements: A novel application with no NHS precedent. 

Ensuring inter-operability: Still to be tested, decisions made in project with this aim not fully tested yet.

Skill shortage: Particular bottleneck found for cloud solutions architects to build the cloud infra-structure needed to host the application and associated services. 

Outcomes: 
A cloud-based relational database and clinical data capture environment was built that now has 20 national audit programmes using it across both health and social care. 
Basic functionality is already in use and advanced / further developments can now be enabled. 

Learning: 

Incremental development ensured that timelines were not fatally long - a ""pilot"" environment was built quickly that had limitations but it allowed users to become familiar, implementation to begin, processes to be tested and refinements made in the final delivery. 

The incremental development was most important for the ""people and processes"" aspect of the work - changing beliefs, ensuring buy-in etc the final technology solution differed minimally from the pilot environment from the user's perspective (although there were big differences in the digital infrastructure).

I think identifying skill shortage / work bottlenecks in advance would have helped set time line expectations, delivery was about 1 year behind schedule. ","26/09/2023, 17:57"

Learning: 
the project team's linking with clinicians from the beginning was a huge benefit.
the ability to do things on the system in more than one way (eg add a referral to a patient's file) has been a problem as different processes have evolved in different teams rather than one standard operating procedure.

Context
The Argyll and Bute Health & Social Care Partnership went live with Eclipse Case Management (ECM) in June 2023.

The Eclipse Project was about delivering to the Argyll & Bute Health & Social Care Partnership’s (A&B H&SCP) a replacement of CareFirst as a platform for the Single Social Care and NHS Community IT System.

The wider strategic deliverables are; single system- health and social care, one stop shop for service users- (not being asked the same questions over and over) cloud based, mobile working, cost savings- staff time, less time in office, supporting development of Electronic Patient Record, improved functionality for users and improved data.

Scope
Whilst the Social Work function and latterly Community Based staff are the primary users of the Eclipse system, Eclipse has become integrated into the operations of multiple teams and functions within both the social care and health arms of the HSCP, as follows:
 Social Care
Social Work Admin
Children & Families (inc. Child Protection, Looked After Children, Children’s Units, Throughcare & Aftercare, CARO, Family Placement, Fostering and Adoption, EEI, EIT) 
Adult Care (inc. Adult Protection, Home Care, Residential Care, Sensory Impairment, Telecare, Substance Misuse, Day Services, Dementia Services)
Learning Disability (inc. Resource Centres, Residential Care, Commuity Outreach)
Mental Health
Criminal Justice
Strategic Finance (All finance areas – residential, non-residential, foster payments, day services etc.)
 Health
NHS Admin
Dietetics
District Nursing
MacMillan Nurses
Community Mental Health Service
Motor Neurone Nurse
Occupational Therapy
Physiotherapy
Podiatry
Speech & Language Therapy
Hospital Wards
 A Financial module is also proposed and must be able to integrate with the Council’s corporate financial management system 
 Document management with support for document retention and disposal housekeeping functionality is available and this is facilitated through an integration between Eclipse and Civica EDMS.
 
Challenges faced
Difficulties finalising teams requirements and processes. Standardising process and  business process engineering. Reconciling regional inconsistencies
ECM supplier over promising system functionality
Difficulties getting end users to undertake thorough Process Acceptance Testing
Restricted resource available for training staff on Eclipse Case Management
Managing staff expectations - stakeholders with varying perspectives. Managing the different needs of stakeholders and the need to align them
Engaging service users with project dry run process. (Staff logging in and checking their data) If data went unchecked this caused issues in go live
User acceptance was difficult to gather
Data migration issues from carefirst (old system) to Eclipse - some data missing during migration
Resistance to change from some stakeholders
A&B HSCP were the first Health Board in Scotland to go live with the Eclipse Justice Module - discovered many data issues and ""bugs"" with the module. Significant work is ongoing with the new Justice Module and OLM as part of the wider development nationally. 
Enhancement requests submitted to the supplier post go live are slow to be validated and implemented - frustration then by end user 

Outcomes of the implementation
Outcomes: At this stage we are still embedding Eclipse (3 months post go-live) and our Eclipse Support Team remain central for supporting this process.
Additional temporary administrative staff are being recruited to the Eclipse Support Team to give additional capacity to support the transfer of outstanding Health and Justice records
An ongoing technical support using Freshdesk is in place with the software company supporting us with this project to resolve Eclipse functionality issues. 
An Eclipse Staff Forum is taking place weekly with key actions identified by staff. This meeting is to allow staff a safe place to discuss and raise issues regarding Eclipse. 

Upon successful conclusion of the project the H&SCP have realised the following benefits.
A case management system that is based on modern technology CloudBased and requires less recurring budget to support and maintain.
A case management system that protects the HSCP against technological and business developments for a period of five to ten years
Ready access to documents complementing electronic data capture that is easy to perform and available where ever patient care is administered.

learning: Continual communication and project updates for staff is crucial. Getting ""buy in"" from stakeholders is helpful. Having a good governance structure in place for decision making is important (Project Team; Project Board, Post go live staff forum, Change control board)
Maintaining and updating project documentation is key (issue log, risk log, changes)
Helping staff adapt to change - having an Eclipse System Support team in place to resolve system and data issues
An Eclipse Change Control Group has been established to ensure that no changes are made to ECM without agreement and sign off using an agreed change management procedure
Preparing staff for a new system is important and getting them to specify their requirements is vital","25/09/2023, 16:54"
Emma Scatterty,HEIN110762023-4,💬 Weeks 1 & 2 Discussion: Reflecting on H&CII implementation,indexIssue6,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"Not an implementation that I managed but one I have experience of:

Context: Roll out of a digital care system to care at home services and care homes across Scotland belonging to a single organisation. 
Scope: The system was to be used primarily by those involved in the delivery of care services as well as those receiving care. Those delivering care would record and receive information via the system, check in and out of visits, managers could overview their service and access reporting using the system, service users could also access their care information on the system. 
Challenges: Upskilling staff to use the system and then embedding it as a way of working. Staff understanding benefits to the service users. Interoperability with existing systems which held the care records of service users and rostering systems. Variation in care delivery in local services due in to both internal and external factors equating to different use of systems. Service user upskilling and engagement. Technical issues such as connectivity across rural services/certain buildings/locations. 
Outcomes: The system saw a number of roll outs before adoption achieved. Ongoing process of training staff and customers, feedback, system improvements, enhancing interoperability with existing systems. System used to deliver new models of care such as a remote 24/7 service.
Learning: People and processes are as crucial as the technology itself. Poor interoperability can make usability challenging. Training and engagement along with frontline feedback key throughout. ","25/09/2023, 12:07"

Office 365/MS Teams was a top down implementation approach with the pandemic being a key disrupter and enabler and the outcome supported staff and patient safety 

TrakCare integrates other HII such as SCI Gateway and SCI Diabetes and is used to record all dietetic interventions.

Michael Curran,HEIN110762023-4,💬 Weeks 1 & 2 Discussion: Reflecting on H&CII implementation,indexIssue5,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"Context: Renewal of an electronic social work assessment tool. The current installed system was highly versatile and could be adapted to the organisations needs. The transformation was adapting and re-modelling the existing system. The intended outcome was to simplify a complex multi module package of tools that had evolved over time. The resulting system had tied social workers to the computer and created random sets of information of inconsistent quality.
Scope: The assessment tool was used by all social workers, physios, OT's, care managers, para professionals and strategic leads to receive referrals, assess, plan care, monitor performance and share agreed plans with care providers. The Goals where two fold: release social workers from a time consuming system and establish a single data set.
Challenges: Stakeholder engagement brought together different professionals with different opinions, requirements and views on what a 'good assessment' looked like. after many months of discussion and heated debate a single resolution could not be found. The key tension was the needs of the organisation to have data (heavily dependent on tick boxes and classifications) and frontline staff who were more in favour of a narrative based approach which did not yield as much data for strategic managers. An executive decision was made in favour of the strategic manager and data.
Outcomes: a system was installed that meant frontline staff had to spend more time at the computer, this was heavily resisted by staff who eventually found a workaround that bypassed a lot of the data fields and reduced their workload. The whole system had to be reengineered sometime later.
learning: Listen to frontline staff and find balance in different needs, create a more collaborative environment.","22/09/2023, 12:04"

Context: Driven by top down national strategy in Scotland for HEPMA system to be available in all Scottish hospitals. One supplier chosen in the national procurement. Most health boards implemented the system on their own. North of Scotland health boards decided to work together and implement it as one system for all 6 health boards (to discuss drivers for that decision would require probably few pages)

Scope: Procurement of one new Pharmacy Stock Control system as 'base' for wider hospital application; implementation of new hospital application to all inpatient wards in NoS region; establishing new regional system support team; system to be built in the cloud environment 

Challenges: Initial agreement that what has been chosen nationally is 'fit for us'; Managing collaboration between 6 independent health boards with different digital maturity levels, staff levels and organisational agility; supplier never before based the system in cloud environment or built the system as multilocality so was learning during the process; impact of the new system on how other hospital systems had to be used to provide safe care

Outcomes: One drug file used in hospital pharmacies across NoS health boards; one hospital medication record available across 6 health boards 'travelling' with the patient; new model for delivering big implementations established for the region; increased collaboration between various professionals in all 6 boards

Successful: ‘Rita’ Deloitte’s AI Bot  - Automate the triage of referrals to the gastroenterology service, Bot to make judgement on what WL to send referral to, thereby releasing clinician time to be spent with patients.
Barriers faced: 
• It was difficult to anonymise patient notes
• There was lots of hurdles with the data processing agreements
Factors that influenced their outcomes:
• Strong clinical leadership by GI consultant and backing from medical director

Unsuccessful: NICE, RPA Bot - software robot to try to take over some repetitive, admin driven processes currently manually done by human resources on PMS.
Barriers faced:
• Bot struggled with complex PMS system and fell over at patching and upgrades.
• Lots of interaction with supplier dev team for workaround fixes which was not a sustainable process.
• The software was difficult to use and navigate, had expensive training and unlike other products did not have forums of other users
(NHS Lothian are now using another bot – UI Path – It is more intuitive, has a community, easy to navigate, seems to handle Trak better…)

The Innovation team have been involved in lots of other AI projects which include:
- Bot for creating Hepma accounts
- WL validation - Message asking patients still attending appointment, create a note in patient record, response makes a secondary note

Barriers faced:
- There is no NHS Lothian policy for using generative AI. (Digital and IT are drafting a strategy for using AI)
- Resourcing challenges - Looking to upskill team as need input from other teams for server requirements etc.
- Medical device regulations
- Information governance concerns
- Not enough standardised data to utilise AI 
- Power apps – too much risk on potential increase of Microsoft licensing costs","27/11/2023, 13:20"

They proposed the use of GPT to create SOAP notes that clinicians could then edit before it would land within the patient's personal EPR. Benefits to this would be that it would decrease charting time allowing for clinicians to spend more time with patients. However, there are grave concerns with this initiative. To name a few concerns: 
GPT is Google, therefore patient data would be freely shared with Google and likely on international servers (concerns around IG - DPIA; cybersecurity threats)
AI generated SOAP notes can breed laziness or poor clinical evaluations due to clinicians not taking the time to fully review AI SOAP notes. This could cause subsequent clinicians to make poor clinical decisions based on potentially inaccurate SOAP notes. 
SOAP notes include a clinical assessment that requires a clinicians judgement, which cannot necessarily be replicated with AI
Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) concerns

Although it may seem like a positive in theory, SOAP notes are not necessarily the best direction for AI in healthcare. Utililsing AI for scheduling, routine reviews, etc. may be a better first step as they are lower risk. ","24/11/2023, 11:37"

This allows me to have informed, (albeit high level) conversations with technical staff that helps drive projects forward. 

It was useful to understand discrete concepts such as terminology (SNOMED), messaging standards (HL7), document structure standards (the ITK distribution envelope), and other concepts as outlined by the openEHR team - syntactic vs semantic standards. 

First - it was important to understand the main scope/ focus of the ITK. It is CDA documents (clinical document architecture documents) - so the first question when considering using the ITK is do i want to transfer clinical documents? - is this the kind of data I am dealing with? 

A HL7 CDA is a ""complete information object"" describing clinical information related to a person. 

Other important high level considerations about how to approach and use the ITK are to ask yourself questions such as: 

Am I developing a system or aiming to acquire a system? (if the latter, then check the ITK conformance catalog for conformant suppliers - good to see Intersystems and InHealthCare are on there (2 major technology suppliers in Scotland! ) 
The conformance catalog is much smaller than I was expecting, other target suppliers I have interest in are not on there. 

Is the system, within the project I am developing seek to send information, receive it or both? Because different parts of the ITK are then relevant. 


I certainly do not understand much of the technical detail in the ITK but found it useful to get a high level overview. ","19/11/2023, 15:11"

This provides opportunities to compare our data against a wider pool internationally and within the UK through international and local codes, such as with SNOMED CT.

AHPs have historically found it hard to report and evidence their role within health and care and we would argue, are subsequently, chronically underfunded with the potential AHPs can have not being recognised. AHPs work across multiple different Health Information Systems and these often result in very limited interoperability, even with basic terminology / definitions used.

My interoperability experience is limited to interfacing systems with TrakCare via Iris/Ensemble. In TrakCare there are the following interface types, HL7, Webservices, ODBC and File Exports /Imports.

InterSystems (TrakCare supplier) support the ITK as part of the core product
Iris/Ensemble (platform for connecting systems), however NHS Lothian developers tend to stick to HL7 standard locally and nationally.

There is a national Ensemble/Iris user group (with a MS teams channel) where technical resources share Integrations experiences with various suppliers. Document exchange in Scotland (between external Parties) is handled by NES and NSS on the NES National Digital platform and NSS National Integration platform, so there is an agreed route for document exchange already in place.

Some of the benefits of using Iris/Ensemble:
- Extend the functionality of standard system Interfaces 
- Allows Data transformation in transit – e.g. mapping SCI Gateway location and specialty codes to TRAK Clinic Codes for eRef workbench
- Local management of data transformation processes 
- Flow control in the event of system outage / unavailability

During the pilot we utilised some formative evaluation, although on reflection from my learning this week further formative evaluation could have been of benefit.
 The examples of what we did include are;
 Survey - completed at the end of the pilot phase to staff, however, this should potentially have been completed multiple times formally during the pilot. 
Clinical audit - reviews of live patients were completed to inform the pan-Lothian approach to patient flow.
Collaborative learning - regular meetings with acute colleagues. 
Key Performance Indicators - identified in the development of the pilot and monitored closely on a daily to monthly basis, this analyse informed the development of the project. 
 However, there was potentially other opportunities for formative evaluation during this pilot;
 Patient focus groups - to inform what their opinions are on the pre-existing pathway / pilot / future vision.
Peer view panel's - with live / recent patients to provide learning opportunities for the pilot and acute teams.

I can see the benefits of a formative evaluation in trying to make sure we work with the service to deliver a model that works for them and their service and patient needs as well as aligning with organisational and national use of the system.
Although the service is 'one team' there are many sub teams with their own process flows within that and I can see how formative evaluation will be a useful tool to ensure we understand all the factors. ","04/10/2023, 15:17"

Data was gathered using an online survey – 1598 respondents (15% - Medical Staff; 29% - Nursing Staff; 27% - Administrative and 19% - Allied Health Professionals), an audit of system usage using inbuilt analytics site visits and structured feedback sessions. The covid pandemic extended the duration of the exercise so that while the online survey and usage analysis took place in 2019, the site visits were undertaken in Sept 2020. The report was finalised and presented to the TrakCare Programme board in Jan 2021. The Digital Oversight Board mandated a project to address all of the recommendations relating to training and communications made by the TrakCare Advance Programme. 

This projects objectives included:
· Deliver hints / tips on existing Trakcare features 
· Implement Trak Champions with a supported MS Teams Channel
· To review the current training model, make recommendations for improvement 
· To understand local effective methods of communication and utilise those. 
· To advertise streamlined Trakcare processes across NHS Lothian.
· To create awareness of new TrakCare features/ developments to targeted audiences.
· To provide information on future TrakCare developments/ strategy to end users.
· To raise awareness of issues, provide timescales for fixes and prompt action for workarounds for impacted users following TrakCare changes.
· To encourage end user confidence in the TrakCare product. 
· To communicate major changes early to reduce friction. 

The project is in its closure phase. The success of the project will be measured against the initial recommendations made by the TrakCare advanced Programme vs the final feedback given by end users after the implementation of all changes. ","03/10/2023, 21:13"

Something that is particularly topical for me is the ability to share information between health and social care systems. We have some elements shared but the different IG processes make it challenging. Bringing stakeholders together who truly want to integrate their systems is key starting point I feel. The LHCRE started with an invitation to participate which indicates a commitment from the organisations who volunteered. Aside from the benefits in healthcare delivery for the patient and clinicians; being able to track patients journey seamlessly through heath and social care using meaningful and standardised data allows us to learn more efficiently about our pathways and identify where we could improve. Currently doing this relies to a certain extent on a manual processes of going into different systems to find the data. ,"22/11/2023, 11:23"

Information could be shared seamlessly between social work, nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, GPs, etc. In regards to healthcare delivery, there was a more streamlined approach and patients would not need to repeat their history repeatedly or carry records between providers as it was all available, which is unlike what occurs in Scotland. The data governance rules and regulations are different in the United States vs Scotland; however, similarities exist such as right amount of information with the right person at the right time. Interoperability wise, systems worked seamlessly between GP systems, hospital systems, social systems, etc, which is unlike Scotland. Finally, patients had access to their records via portals and apps and could communicate with health and social care professionals after appointments to ensure data was taken accurately, which again does not occur in Scotland.

use our data for review of our clinical performance and outcomes
identify trends allowing us to focus on where intervention and focus is required within the service. 
inform service development and planning
assess our data quality on a large scale
provide up to date information to the public in the form of our monthly infographics
review and digitalize some of our administrative processes

I think we have just seen the tip of the iceberg locally in how we can use data to improve care and the service however in order to do that we need to enough people in the organisation that have expertise building reports and analysing the data.

There has also been the opportunity to submit data to form national datasets which can be linked in secure research environments.

Analytic skills are important but it's more important to engage directly with services to understand the problems they are trying to resolve. Clinical engagement is key to the success of these processes which makes the sharing and generalisability of output more difficult.","09/11/2023, 16:01"

In my role, it is data on access to, and evaluation of, learning resources that is the key data set. Completion rates for learning resources, could be used more effectively alongside other data sets to determine actual impact on clinical outcomes, practice, confidence of staff, etc. It is always difficult to know if effective educational resources have made an impact on practice rather than other factors - leadership, culture, processes, etc - and more analysis could be conducted to dive deeper into this.

Evaluation data gathered is also crucial, and there is a need to review this in a timely fashion, to be able to understand and act on feedback from staff. ","05/11/2023, 09:16"

I think it is too often not used to its full potential and services like the dataloch are hopefully seeking to address this. 

These secondary uses could be categorised (functions):

Business intelligence: Analyzing capacity and performance in delivering organisational functions
Clinical quality performance and audit: Are clinical outcomes reaching set standards
Individual patient management: Safety alerts, ""precision medicine"" - individualizing clinical decision making through use of data driven algorithms, automation of clinical decision making
Population health: tracking and predicting disease trends
Research: Generating new knowledge by uncovering previously unknown associations or causal pathways of disease

I have noticed that Business intelligence teams (sometimes referred to as healthcare analysts or healthcare intelligence teams) are quite focused on organisational functions. I always think the disconnect between ""business"" and clinical teams is a shame - the Business intelligence teams hold a wealth of powerful data at their finger tips and have the skills to analyse it but I think this is under-utilized for direct clinical healthcare improvement since they are mainly focused on analysing demand and capacity as organisational priorities. 

I think both should be important and through better clinical use of data we could potentially reduce demand or at least make services more efficient. ","02/11/2023, 20:12"

I'm very excited about this class as digital technology and software development are some key interests of mine within the realm of data science.

My background is working is psychiatric research through a University setting. We were funded through NIH and other government sources at University of California, San Diego. The populations I worked with were all veterans and mainly US Marines who were deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan (OIF/OEF). My lab was studying PTSD development and risk factors, especially those from childhood.

I'd like to continue working within the mental health sphere, in areas where I can push for more effective and efficient patient care, and most importantly patient-centered care wherein treatments are tailored for the individual.

The issue that I am thinking about is the long waiting time for elective total joint replacement surgery in Hong Kong. While this may be a structural problem, I hope to explore solutions that could improve patient's wellbeing during their wait as a short-medium term aid.
Reasons :
The waiting time is at an alarming level, and the situation is expected to worsen. As of 2023, the median waiting time of elective total joint replacement surgery went up to > 40 months in some regions.
Negative impact to quality of life for a long time, which could be eased with technology at a lower cost
Stakeholders:
Primary Users:
Patients waiting for elective total joint replacement surgery, and can be extended to those who had recently undergone these surgeries.
Developing Partners & Users of data : 
Hospitals (Healthcare Services Provider) - 1. as partners of development and content provider; 2. data users to improve healthcare services;
Social Care service provider - e.g. to guide patients in using the tool (considered the digital literacy); 
Investors: 
Insurers & government 
Proposed digital technology solution (preliminary): 
The core value is to empower patients in taking better care of themselves during the long wait. Covering: 
Digital platforms featuring wellness information and customised content provided by the patient's healthcare providers (e.g. video provided by his/her physiotherapists ).
To be integrated with existing wearables / posture detector (*more research needed):* for level of activity/posture self-tracking

Background: Capacity challenges in current health visitor service and ongoing early years support in England, combined with the challenges of the cost-of-living crisis on parents, means families are not always receiving the prompt support and attention they deserve. (ref: IHV, 2023)
Rationale for approaching with digital technology: Providing digital infrastructure, primarily through a mobile application for new parents (similar to or within the NHS App), to support the core 'in person' interactions between a health visitor and the family they support would enable:
a) integration of key early years data (the 'Red Book') with other NHS data sources b) identification of common trends, patterns and risk factors for children and their parents c) possible 'triaging' of questions raised to tailor the support to the individual (e.g. via written response/e-consult/in-person visitation).

To prevent compounding of the existing illness in patients
To improve patient education and reduce travel
why should this be approached with digital technology?

In Malawi, despite a commendable 4-star rating in digital maturity phase, significant challenges persist within the healthcare system. One pressing issue is the strain on resources, particularly in terms of staff availability and limited hospital space for consultations, leading to prolonged waiting times and compromised quality of care.
The choice to address this specific problem stems from the urgent need to improve healthcare access and delivery, ensuring that all citizens receive timely and effective medical attention. Adding to this, the utilization of digital technology is important in improving healthcare systems, enhancing efficiency, and overcoming resource constraints.
Stakeholders involved in this solution will include healthcare providers, patients, policymakers, and soaftware developers. Healthcare professionals will play an important role in designing and implementing the digital platform/application, ensuring its alignment with clinical standards and patient needs. Patients will benefit directly from improved access to medical advice and reduced waiting times. Policymakers will need to support the integration of digital solutions into existing healthcare infrastructure, while soaftware engineers will be responsible for creating user-friendly, regulatory compliant, and secure platforms.
The proposed digital technology solution involves the development of an online doctor-to-patient consultation platform or application. This platform will enable patients to seek medical advice remotely, reducing unnecessary visits to hospitals and alleviating congestion in hospitals. Additionally, the application will facilitate appointment scheduling for patients requiring physical examinations or further diagnostic tests.

This system would gather patient data in real time, including oxygen saturation, blood pressure, heart rate, and more, using wearable technology. After that, the information would be sent to a system of emergency alerts. An emergency number may be connected to the RPM system.

There has been multiple times I have seen a great digital product fail in implementation as it is been done as a side project or added piece of work for an already over run service.

Partnerships also need to look at supporting third-sector agencies to engage in the upgrade to digital projects such as case management systems as ideally the data and reporting from these more sophisticated platforms will help the sharing of information when required and allow the agency to better manage those they work with. Having informal support on how to manage such systems from areas that are already involved would be a great start.","23/04/2024, 07:36"

During my time working at UCSD, we switched to a new software for handling IRB communications & review. However, the roll-out ended up being a disaster and I think it's a great example of technology not being sufficiently prototyped or customizable. They ended up lumping together IRB and protocol access with finances and budget information. For our lab and many others within our department, this became a huge issue, since the fund managers we work with were not previously allowed access to sensitive data and study documentation. However, at the switch, those fund managers had the highest access and had to grant access to others, even though they weren't trained in IRB policy handling. We couldn't add part-time or volunteer staff to have document access without giving full budgeting access. It became a mess for the whole department. Worst of all, the software pooled the budgets for all the active research within our department. So fund managers and P.Is had to go through and try to figure out how much money they had and keep track of it separately anyway. It's clear that measures must be taken to ensure technology will behave how expected and that it will actually be helpful, rather than create more work for everyone.","08/05/2024, 21:47"
Bobby McClung,HEIN110432023-4,Week 4: Discussion 1 - Barriers to deployment - some reflections,indexIssue3,indexIssue,indexIssue,indexIssue,"Within a large Health and Social Care Organisation it is very difficult to please all parties when it comes to the purchase and roll out of a large system that is designed to cover statutory recording, information gathering and storing and financial payments among many other issues.

If the organisation does not have good ethos and a clear plan and agreement of how this system will work for them, their staff and the communities they support then this will automatically put the system on the back foot, along side those who are rolling this out and adopting this.

Staff need to understand a new way of practice is required with the movement to new technology, which will bring benefits, but the culture and process change can be difficult for staff to understand and lead to lack of engagement and adoption. Managers need to ensure they are at the forefront of the adoption piece as this allows staff to be brought on board.","08/05/2024, 09:49"

We hope you find it helpful.

Think the main concepts to highlight are

Justifications for edge computing and that it’s generally done to improve response times and reduce bandwidth or where real time decision making is critical
That it’s not just about data but the processing of data. For instance in a self driving vehicle, transmitting video, lidar and radar image data for central processing is bandwidth heavy and uses lots of cabling that adds vehicle weight. Processing in the hardware to indicate locations, vectors and speeds of other vehicles or objects and identify them (e.g. in radar a bike vs a human walking give doppler shifts) is more useful as it’s a small amount of data that can then be transferred (which is also quicker)
In health, a good example is an online mobile cardiac monitor – streaming that data is bandwidth heavy for cloud processing but if you can then move the inference ai to the device (once the full data has perhaps done learning or training on the cloud) then you save considerable mobile bandwidth and potentially battery life if specialist hardware is used
It’s not just about servers, docker, Kubernetes etc but as often smart devices and custom processors that can do machine learning better or quicker than cloud compute and save power when compared to that used for wireless data transmission
In terms of servers, can also offer improved privacy and security. Also redundancy such as air traffic control and management of failover systems
Might be worth a look at MEC - https://www.etsi.org/technologies/multi-access-edge-computing and Edge AI - https://edge-ai-tech.eu and https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-ai for areas in development now. Also ‘Fog computing’ seen as next evolution https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_computing Good paper on fog for assisted living environments here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7802535
Nothing I see really replaces Kubernetes and Docker type deployment (yet). Some youtube videos offer courses/tutorials - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X48VuDVv0do https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c-iBn73dDE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HchRyqNtkU and the official manuals/training are useful
Lot of work on self healing seems to be a trend and managing failovers and redundancy","10/05/2024, 09:41"
