---
In the notes we have:

T1 Disease 10 18 Diabetes - FALSE POSITIVE (**THIS ONE WAS WRONG**)
T2 Drug 30 36 Insulin - TRUE POSITIVE (in both gold and pred)
T3 Disease 50 58 Diabetes - FALSE NEGATIVE

PRED:

T1 Disease 10 19 Diabetes - FALSE POSITIVE
T2 Drug 30 36 Insulin - TRUE POSITIVE (in both gold and pred)


So in the notes it should be:

GOLD:

T1 Disease 10 18 Diabetes - FALSE NEGATIVE (it was not predicted, but it IS there. Because of the typo in 18/19)
T2 Drug 30 36 Insulin - TRUE POSITIVE (in both gold and pred)
T3 Disease 50 58 Diabetes - FALSE NEGATIVE (it was not predicted, but it IS there)

PRED:

T1 Disease 10 19 Diabetes - FALSE POSITIVE (it was predicted, but it IS NOT there. because of the typo in 18/19)
T2 Drug 30 36 Insulin - TRUE POSITIVE (in both gold and pred)"

When hints are not opening correctly (usually after restarting the RStudio) it means that RStudio LOST CONTEXT of what project it should be referring to (so it does not where to look for hints)."
5,Franz Kr√§mer,15 Nov 2024 18:35,Help us to make this course better: Bugs and Features,"I would kindly like to make a suggestion regarding the documentation of the code. I stumbled upon this when working on Badge 8. In the notebook there are some custom functions. When trying to work through them, I found it occasionally a bit hard to grasp what their arguments are and where these arguments will come from and what the result is expected to be. Maybe it would make things a bit clearer if there was a short docstring above such functions that tells about the parameters and expected results. Maybe such docstrings could even be used as a way of explaining things. Howevery, this is probably more relevant for the next round of the course, where a short introduction into how to read these docstrings could be provided."

For the pair-programming part of the tutorials it would be great to have a reminder about sharing the file worked on together and how to do this (in Noteable particularly).

15,Dylan Delmar,29 Oct 2024 22:16,Help us to make this course better: Bugs and Features,"Hi,

There's a line of code that's not behaving as it should in notebook 2b
r strplusregex
 
my_sentence <- ""Hello, how are you today? I am looking forward to fun with NLP. What time does it start? It starts at 1pm, do you want to do lunch at 12pm?""
 
 
# Extract any number of digits immediately followed by 'pm'
time1 <- str_extract(my_sentence, ""\\d+pm"")
print(time1)
 

It's supposed to extract any number of digits, so I expect it to print out ""1pm"" , ""12pm"". However, it only finds 1pm. Does a range of digit lengths need to be specified?

Thanks!"

I just wanted to let you know that in the RMarkdown file for the Badge 3 the code chunk in line 104 is not working.

I think the issue is that the names function cannot take a column by name (i.e. Corona_DF$TweetAt), but it has to be named with the position (in that case: names(Corona_DF)[5])

Looking forward to seeing you later!"
