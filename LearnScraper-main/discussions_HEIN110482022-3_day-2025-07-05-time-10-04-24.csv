Introduction to databases and information systems (2022-2023)[FLEX]
Week 1 - Three stars and a wish (⭐⭐⭐💭)","*started to think about databases in a different light - a more-concrete understanding of the notion ""data is everywhere"")
* different types of databases and their applications
* how to run a few SQL queries (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc)
-need to run a few more rounds of practice with different conditions, etc. The grammar used in SQL queries is intuitive, but would need more practice to build a stronger memory (to the level of auto-complete!)"

Week 1 - Three stars and a wish (⭐⭐⭐💭)","⭐️ I have more of a handle on the meaning of and differences between; databases, DBMS, information systems and applications that access the database.
⭐️. Basic knowledge of the general form and order of elements in a SELECT expression to query a relational database.
⭐️ Awareness of (& excitement about) the open source databases available.
💭 No clue yet about what the rules/possibilities are for developing databases for local use within an NHS organisation in the context of maintaining data protection & restrictions on open source IT."

Week 1 - Three stars and a wish (⭐⭐⭐💭)","*SQL queries and tidyverse functions similar which has helped me 
*few rules around formatting SQL but good to follow conventions to facilitate sharing of code
*databases and information systems are everywhere and underpin many activities I am involved with every day

Week 1 - Three stars and a wish (⭐⭐⭐💭)","* began the journey of learning a new language
* found there can be multiple ways of producing the same output
* eyes opened into the many types of database systems and software
- very understandable commands but need to secure the grammar in my head"

Week 2 – Three stars and a wish (⭐⭐⭐💭)","⭐️ Better handle on how to format sql code to make it human readable.
⭐️ Got some sense of the range of simple conditional, boolean etc operators and functions available to SELECT.
⭐️ A structure/nomenclature around dirty data.
💭 Need to refer to notes a lot to remind myself of the syntax, not much is yet in my long-term memory."

Week 3 – Three stars and a wish (⭐⭐⭐💭)","⭐️ Better idea of range of options with database deployment (although still need to understand to what extent our own organisation uses SaaS/Cloud vs self-hosted).
⭐️ I understand the principles behind joins, primary and foreign keys.
⭐️ The will to improve data sharing as detailed in the 7th Caldicott principle.
💭 Still need a lot more practice before the sql syntax is embedded."
