44,Paolo Pricoco,18 Nov 2024 09:51,Badge 01 - Mini-Diary: 3 stars and 1 wish ⭐️⭐️⭐️🚀,"⭐ Patterns in the language are used to predict words and parts of speech in texts. For example, after an ""a"" or an ""an"", it's very likely that we'll see a noun. Rule-based methods in NLP are relatively easy to understand by humans and don't require a huge datasets to be kept track of. However, they require all rules to be set manually.

⭐ In ML-based NLP, after pre-processing we perform ""Feature extraction"". Features are qualities that characterize words; for example, they can be different parts of speech. Limitations of ML-based approaches: they require supervised learning, that is, words must be labelled. This implies the action of professionals (e.g., clinicians in the health care field) to manually establish features and labels.

⭐ The outstanding feature of DL is that it doesn't require manually input data. As larger and larger datasets are being fed into DL-based AI, these programs are becoming increasingly better at understanding the intricacies of human language, including its ambiguities. However, DL requires large amounts of data and computationally expensive infrastructure (GPU, memory, etc.). Also, sometimes they can be like a ""black box"", meaning that it can be difficult for us to explain why certain decisions are made, which is can be ethically crucial in health care.

❓ I am wondering about how health care institutions and ethics boards can assess whether public interventions based of AI-made decisions are fully appropriate and ethical.

⭐ There are subtle, but important, differences in R between data-frames and tibbles. Tibbles are modern versions of traditional R data-frames. Although they do not support row names, they are more user-friendly than data-frames as they automatically infer column types, their subtypes always return tibbles (maintaining structure), and they integrate seamlessly with other widely used packages from the tidyverse. Unfortunately, though, some older R functions do not work with tibbles, but this generally compensated for by the presence of newer and more user-friendly alternatives to those functions.

⭐ One of the advantages of using the read_csv() function from tidyverse as opposed to read.csv() from base R is that the former will always interpret text as character data, while the latter converts all character variables into factors by default. To avoid this, we generally have to pass the argument stringsAsFactors = FALSE.

❓Given the sometimes not insignificant differences in syntax and compatibility between base R and tidyverse functions, I am wondering whether one should opt to make use of only one of the two approaches in all R scripts, in order to ensure readability and easy modifiability of the scripts by other professionals, or mixing the two approaches can sometimes be a good idea."

🌟Some examples of cleaning and normalisation are: setting words to lower- or uppercase, switching digits or other types of characters with a pre-set word, e.g., ""digit"" or ""symbol"", etc. Of course, we have to pay attention to the potential consequences of such changes. For instance, setting all text to lowercase may reduce alter the meaning of some words/sentences, reducing emphasis on words or hiding headings and titles in a text.
Further examples of cleaning and normalisation are abbreviations, use of special characters, removal of tags from HTML, SQL and other codes, email addresses, etc. Punctuation can also be made consistent in a text.

🌟Tokenisation is a process that breaks unstructured text into chunks of information, called tokens. These can consist of a letter, a word, a sequence of words or they can be as long as paragraphs, and they deliver a single message or have a common meaning.

❓In this and the following badges, I have learned that very frequent words such as ""the"", ""a"" and ""an"" may have substantial importance. However, in this badge, they were used as examples of words on which to apply cleaning and normalisation. I am wondering in which cases they are more important and why."

🌟 Tokenisation splits the text into discrete elements or tokens. In R, this can be done with the unnest_tokens function, which removes the punctuation by default (i.e. strip_punct = TRUE) and converts strings to lower case (i.e. to_lower = TRUE)

🌟Multiple words and phrases are called n-grams, where n is the number of words.

This means we can identify words that often go together and sparse words, which are often stray. The TM package is a good R package to work with document term matrices for term frequency. It is possible to count words for long texts by using the function unnest_tokens(), and then count(..., sorted=TRUE) to have the final count of each word in the text.

🌟 There are different approaches to counting word frequencies are: binary weights (answers the question ""does the word appear in the text? Yes or no""); term frequency (tf); Inverse Document Frequency (IDF). In IDF, we assign higher scores to words which are most unusual, that is, they appear less in the text. It is dividing the total n° of documents by the n° of documents containing the corpus, and taking the natural logarithm of it. The fewer the documents that contain the word (denominator), the rarer the word.

🌟 Term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) is a measure of how a word is important in a corpus relative to how important it is in all documents. Therefore, TF-IDF is: lower for words that appear frequently in many documents; higher for words that appear frequently in the documents of a corpus (i.e., few documents).
TF-IDF has proven to be very useful in internet search, where search engine were able to identify documents in which a word was particularly relevant compared to other documents.

❓I wonder when we are supposed to look for higher frequencies in the occurrence of words, as opposed to looking for unusual words (lower frequencies). Are there algorithms that help us establish whether a word is to be searched for based on its rarity in the text as opposed to its abundance?"

(Edited by Paolo Pricoco on 24 Nov 2024 11:53)",Badge 06 - Mini-Diary: 3 stars and 1 wish ⭐️⭐️⭐️🚀,"🌟 Stemming is a normalisation technique that reduces words down to their root (called stem), by removing prefixes and suffixes. Sometimes, root or stem words are not meaningful (e.g., “studi” from “studies”), as stemming does not always respect grammar rules. On the other hand, lemmatisation is a more complex technique that interprets text in order to preserve the meaning of the words and follow grammar rules. It analyses also other parts of speech to improve this interpretation process. Fortunately, the ""textstem"" package in R is very helpful to carry out lemmatisation process.

🌟 Part of Speech (POS) tagging consists in assigning labels to words based on their role in the sentence as parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, but also subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, etc. It is generally preceded by tokenisation, since words or groups of words have to be considered separately. Since POS uses labels, it can benefit from supervised ML, like support vector machines (SVMs) and neural networks. We can use R packages like UDPipe or openNLP both for POS tagging and lemmatisation, and for this we need to make use of pre-created language models for POS labelling. For example, UDPipe (Universal Dependencies Pipeline) produces groups of labels that are called ""upos"" (universial POS) and ""xpos"" (specific POS).

🌟A fairly good example of a text pre-processing pipeline could be: (1) lowercase, (2) removal of punctuation, (3) stop word and non-meaningful word, (4) special characters, (5) stemming or lemmatisation (preferably the latter, if feasible), (6) tokenisation.

🌟 Part of speech (POS) tagging is about assigning every word their syntactic category and is often conducted before lemmatisation. Some tagging systems are language agnostic (e.g. UPOS) and other are language-specific (XPOS)

Thanks to DV, we can measure similarity between documents, we can classify them and group them into cluster, and we can apply information retrieval on them.

🌟It's important not to assume that relatively simple Feature Extraction approach, such as One-hot encoding (OHE) and Bag of Words (BoW), have been completely superseded by more cutting-edge methods like Decision Trees/Random Forest or Neural Network-based methods. In fact, OHE and BoW are still pretty widely used for datasets that are not too large or in which word order and relationships do not play a significant role.

🌟Also logistic regression can be used in ML for Feature Extracion. Naïve Bayes method is based on the Bayes theorem and it assumes that features are independent of each other (this is sometimes called “naïve” assumption). It works well with sparse data, without significant relationships with each other. It is used in spam classification, as it can classify documents, messages or emails as spam or non-spam simply based on the presence or absence of certain words.

Then, entities can be link to other words labelled as entity modifiers, such as location, time, type (e.g., type of disease, type of treatment, etc.). A complex type of entities are nested entities, meaning that each entity can contain one or more sub-entities and that each word or chunk of text can be labelled in more than one way.

🌟Case uses of NER range from journalism, to search tools, recommendation and advertising, social media monitoring, sentiment analysis, customer service and healthcare. In healthcare, NER is used to identify data regarding genes, diseases, treatment, ICD code, etc. As it occurs in many fields of NLP, ambiguity of text, context, language variability and drift over time, and sparsity and paucity of training data (together with complex nested entities) are the main challenges of NER.

🌟BIO (Begin-Inside-Ouside) tagging scheme labels words as begin, inside or outside, where “being” is the beginning of an entity, “inside” is a feature related to it or a modifier, “outside” is a word unrelated to the entity. In this way, less important words (“outside”) are partly ignored (almost filtered out), while entities and their modifiers become preponderant for text interpretation.

❓I haven’t fully grasped how BIO tagging works. As far as I have understood, only some words are chosen as entities, and choice depends on the meaning the words have in the text. I was wondering how we could teach AI to understand which noun is to be considered an entity and which one isn’t, considering that, without context, it is sometimes difficult even for humans to tell the two apart."

Overlooking these crucial aspects in health care can lead to an exacerbation of cognitive bias and inequalities in healthcare, which can ultimately cause harm to patients and a decrease in trust in healthcare systems.

🌟 To avoid bias related to demographic characteristics of patients, such as age, gender, ethnicity/race and religion, it is good practice to ensure our data is balanced among different demographic groups. Also, it is paramount to consider how we source data, making sure it doesn’t exclude relevant groups and minorities in the population.

🌟 To mitigate the risk of bias, we have several tools at our disposal, such as disparity analysis; resampling; algorithm fairness adjustment like adversarial weighting, fair embedding techniques, fairness constraints.

277,Paolo Pricoco,5 Dec 2024 11:25,Badge 13 - Mini-Diary: 3 stars and 1 wish ⭐️⭐️⭐️🚀,"🌟In NLP practice, it is fundamental to keep data private. Data privacy can be jeopardized by direct and indirect identifiers. While the former contain clear data that is supposed to be kept confidential (e.g., address, phone number, religion, sexual orientation), the latter consist in clues that can help identify private data (e.g., the position of a user’s relative to a certain building, or a high number of yearly haematological clinical check-ups; these bits of information could help narrow down the list of possible subjects by identifying their accommodation or the presence of a haematological disease).

🌟Unfortunately, many NLP algorithms designed to spot direct and indirect identifiers do not seem to work very well in real contexts, as they struggle with picking up on language nuances, shifts, jargon, etc. It comes as no surprise that this phenomenon is enhanced when trying to detect indirect identifiers, as they may be less likely to have a clear recurrent pattern (for example, as opposed to a direct identifiers such as age, where we generally encounter a number followed by “year old”).

🌟 In Scotland, a topic modelling analysis on hospital discharge reports was conducted and five main macro-area topics were found: (1) unique events (events that happened, like an incident); (2) social information: parents, children, family, school, etc; (3) location and organizations (mainly places); (4) mental health: details about psychiatric disorders; (5) police and crime: criminal record.
I found very interesting that when privacy risk was higher for one topic, it was also likely to be higher for other topics.

❓ With regards to the aforementioned topic modelling analysis on hospital discharge reports, I wonder if a NLP tool could be created, which helps the professional identify the causes of increased privacy risk across more than one topic as opposed to one specific topic. For example, in some cases this tool could detect malpractice in data recording that affects all area of interest, while in other cases it could spot a flaw in data collection related to only one area (and perhaps promote training and education for the staff responsible for that area)."

⭐ Fascinating fireside chat - interesting to hear about desired outcomes from NLP technology. Interestingly in my professional role, I have worked on creating what we call an 'After Visit Summary' (AVS) which is specifically generated for a patient following a clinic appointment or inpatient admission. Much of this document is generated through a combination of structured information ( eg. discrete home medications list) and non structured text (including written post-discharge/follow-up instructions for the patient). Whilst not fully automated (since it relies on a clinician writing instructions and prescribing/amending drugs as needed) the document is generated into a structured, patient-friendly one-pager which we send to their patient portal if they signed up for an account. I'm so curious if NLP would be able to produce the same document, or better, with less up front work involved
⭐Another interesting point - importance of engaging clinicians in system/NLP design. I completely agree, but I'd also add that it is beneficial if the clinicians involved also have at least a baseline understanding of how the core technology works (whether NLP, an EPR, analytics, etc.) The stark reality of working in underfunded health sectors is that we don't have endless time, resources and money to design clinical workflows which we then have to rebuild or completely unpick due to a lack of understanding of the technology from project commencement, and the risk of the just 'replicate what we did on paper' mindset. Digital systems absolutely need to be designed by clinicians with patients at the heart, but the pre-digital process/pathway also needs to be robust
❓""Garbage in, garbage out"" - fascinating point. I find this particularly interesting because I hear the term ""garbage"" floated around fairly frequently when used to describe the impact of poor quality documentation on trying to extract discrete data (let alone unstructured data) from databases. The question I have on this point is, are we saying ""garbage"" documentation is down to poor practice of clinicians documenting superfluous/inappropriate data, or is this subjective because ""superfluous"" to one specialty is ""beneficial"" to another. If the latter, this seems like a massive consideration in NLP model design; how do we define what is important and what is not if clinicians cannot agree or have differing opinions on this?

That means they should be easily modifiable, implementable, and interpretable. This required a long-term vision that entails both the structure of the code, which should be divided into clearly identifiable sections to help coders interpret it, and a gaze into how social and linguistic trends, models, ideologies and pattern are changing and are likely to change in the near and not-so-near future.

🌟 Also, it is important to make NLP algorithm output interpretable and explainable by human operators. As we know, AI methods (including NLP algorithms) run the risk of creating poorly interpretable or explainable outputs, as the coded decision-making process is sometimes so complicated and so many times iterated that it could be lost as the code is running. Especially in healthcare, it is important that our NLP algorithms are accompanied by a description of how the major decisions were made and major findings were obtained. In this way, AI will not dictate our decisions and the resulting policy, but rather it will be a support in our decision-making.

🌟 NLP should also make user experience easier and increase efficiency. Often times very complicated algorithms may result in user experience becoming less intuitive and both coders and healthcare professionals may get lost in the sea of options and sub-settings that sophisticated NLP tools provide. On the contrary, NLP should integrate into human experience as a “silent collaborator”, increasing efficiency where humans lack tools and computing (brain) power, and ensuring clarity and readability of procedures and outcomes.

⭐️ Include the user at every step of development (no matter how good the functionality is, if the interface is poorly designed or integrated, it will not be used)
⭐️ Great to hear about the impact NLP is and can have in the future!
🚀 Have there been any initiatives to use LLMs in the NHS specifically? if so, what considerations around data security have been made? NHS locally deployed models over APIs owned by model owners?"

⭐️ Future applications of NLP could break down silos between health and social care (e.g., by analysing social factors of health like housing or access to certain services), contributing to a more holistic view on health.
⭐️ NLP tools are for humans and therefore, we need to think about how they can be built to fit into workflows, integrate with existing systems and conditions and to be trustworthy.
🚀 It would be interesting to know more about real world cases of NLP tool development and implementation in an organizational context and learn from them about which actors to involve, how to involve them, what to avoid."

305,Joseph Oxley,22 Nov 2024 11:35,Badge 14 - Mini-Diary: 3 stars and 1 wish ⭐️⭐️⭐️🚀,"⭐️ Importance of being able to explain how a NLP model made a decision, so that trust in NLP increases and models are able to be more widely used in a clinical setting.

⭐️Importance of issues such as bias to ensure NLP models are equally applicable and that the performance of the models are not different between groups. (As this could worsen health outcomes for some groups as models become more widely used.)

⭐️Importance of the user interface and how any model or tool fits into a workflow. This could involve connecting directly to clinical systems so data does not need to be manually input to a model separately, or the model being able to return a prediction quickly instead of relying on external processing.

🚀Any information on if the NHS in the UK has a formal strategy to adopt and implement NLP or Machine learning approaches going into the future? Or if it is still very much the case of development and implementation of these models varying across the system."

313,Paolo Pricoco,5 Dec 2024 11:59,Badge 15 - Mini-Diary: 3 stars and 1 wish ⭐️⭐️⭐️🚀,"🌟 Technical coding skill improvement does not guarantee an NLP professional to be well-trained and effective in a particular sector (e.g., healthcare). The specific, often fast-pace-changing contingencies of healthcare (as well as many areas of work) require NLP practitioners to keep up to date not only with the new coding languages and packages, but also with healthcare policies, epidemics and spread of new diseases, socio-economical issues affecting healthcare services in various countries, etc. Also, thanks to the advancements of research, treatment and diagnosis improve and change over time.

🌟 Sensitivity towards social causes, too, should not be overlooked by NLP practitioners. Ignoring these may lead to enhance disparities and biases based on social groups. Inequalities based on gender, economic status, ethnicity and religion among others should be considered when creating NLP algorithms, as the risk for this type of biases being already present in the analysed text is very high.

🌟 With regards to merely technical aspects, coders can hone their coding skills by subscribing to courses specifically designed for intermediate or advanced NLP online. Several online courses are also offered for free or at a very low price.

❓ I am wondering if there are any courses explaining how to address social biases in language and outlining what the main challenges are for NLP practitioners in relation to social bias are. I think it would help creating better-informed NLP coders, which would be especially important for areas, such as healthcare, where very sensitive data is managed."
