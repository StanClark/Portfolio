Introduction to data science in health and social care (2023-2024)[FLEX]
Week 1: Health and Social Care Delivery and Organisation (⭐⭐⭐❓)","1. I learned that the National Assistance Act was passed at the same time of the NHS’ creation and that it was intended to cover ‘residual cases’ not covered under other legislation. I was interested in what Bottery writes – that this wording led to social care, even today, being treated as a second class until later legislation outlined social care in England and Scotland more thoroughly. In my own work with social care and clinical commissioning groups, I have observed this sense of inequality felt by social care workers. 
2. I was surprised at the relatively modern definition of health offered by WHO in 1948, coming from a healthcare system aimed at treating disease rather than enhancing well-being and enabling individuals to live the life they aspire to. 
3. I did not know before this week that the NHS was one of the largest employers in the world. 
? I had not encountered the term health system before this week. I thought it was especially interesting to consider the components of a health system – such as familial carers – that might be more difficult to capture with standard methods of data collection. I would like to know more about research projects that have considered factors of human health that are sometimes excluded, or thought of as ‘outside’ healthcare."

Week 1: Health and Social Care Delivery and Organisation (⭐⭐⭐❓)","3 things I learnt
Organisation of health and social care can greatly impact the delivery and effectiveness of care.
Integrated health care improves on care such as providing personalised care for patients as care will be delivered based on their wants/wishes. It also improves upon the efficiency of care.
We need to keep auditing and re-auditing our data to enable us learn what methods are most effective to use. For example the study on methods/systems used in care homes. How a lot care homes are still paper based and how it is difficult to retrieve patient data from care homes.

I wish I understood better how to organise health systems for better integration. Is there a formula that makes it easier for all the parts of the health and social care system to talk to each other? Or is it mostly just artificial barriers? "

Introduction to data science in health and social care (2023-2024)[FLEX]
Week 1: Health and Social Care Delivery and Organisation (⭐⭐⭐❓)","⭐ This week has broadened my viewpoint on the idea of health compared to my earlier understanding. Initially, I defined health as the absence of physical and mental illnesses. However, I now understand health as the human capacity to autonomously navigate the ever-changing physical, emotional, and social challenges of life. It involves the ability to sustain a feeling of well-being and fulfillment, even when one is living with a chronic disease or disability.

⭐ My perspective on health systems has expanded to encompass not only the traditional healthcare facilities but also all entities, individuals, and initiatives whose central goal is to enhance, rehabilitate, or sustain health. This entails not only interventions focused on health determinants but also direct measures aimed at enhancing well-being. Consequently, a health system extends beyond the conventional healthcare institutions providing individual health services.

⭐ Previously, my perception of social care was limited to notions of welfare, grants, and support directed at specific populations, such as the elderly or individuals with disabilities. I also associated it with services and policies aimed at protecting and assisting particular groups in society with specific needs. However, I now realize that the scope of social care extends far beyond these narrow confines. It encompasses elements that should be applicable to all individuals, although it may be utilized more regularly by specific groups of people.


❓Building on my newfound awareness of social care, I'm eager to explore how this concept applies to diverse societies and gain a deeper understanding of its implications. I want to delve into the ways in which social care can promote inclusivity, well-being, and equity across different cultures and communities"

⭐ A example of definition of social care (i.e. supporting people to be able to live independently etc.).

⭐ As a starting point : different angles to evaluate the health and social care system critically, such as how local community responses and sustainability. These angles might sometimes be overlooked and it helped inspire me to consider third-party data (or information) that could be relevant when conducting analysis.

⭐ I learned about what social care is and its definitions.

Week 1: Health and Social Care Delivery and Organisation (⭐⭐⭐❓)","First, I learned was the definition of health has changed with the development of better management for chronic disease. Before the definition would be a state of complete well-being of physical, mental, and social with the absence of disease. But these days people with chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic obstructive lung disease, and even cancer can have a fulling life and function as an active part of the community.

Secondly. I used the term social services quite interchangeably during hospital work without knowing that it consists of so many differences from other parts such as offender accommodation services or adult placement services which are new to me.


Thirdly, to my surprise, the funding for children and families consists of only one-fifth of the social spending. I would have expected more funding for children's care. Part of me thinks that if we have a good education when the child is younger, would expect a contribute to a good lifestyle which can lead to an indirect reduction of physical and mental in adulthood.

Lastly, I wish to learn more about person-centered care. The complexity of tailored individual care varies greatly from patient to patient. Without additional funding and time would only add on to the already unbearable workload of the healthcare worker. I would be keen to hear how other healthcare systems overcome this.

Three things learned:
⭐ Inclusion of people who are living well with chronic health conditions in the definition of health
⭐ Historical reasons for huge disparity between and separation of Health and Social care structures
⭐ The role of integrated care in provision of coordinated, personalised, and unified approaches to health and social care, and how this has been done in Scotland with some examples

One thing I wish I understood better
❓ Health and Social Care Northern Ireland (HSCNI): From my perspective as a secondary care clinician, it seems to me that care within the HSCNI (which is nominally an integrated care system) often appears disjointed, with numerous fragmented communication and coordination pathways, which leads to many challenges in ensuring seamless patient care. How does one start to integrate a system which is allegedly already integrated?? 🤔Presumably data collection and analysis can provide the answer, or at least raise the question to those responsible for healthcare policymaking."

1. I have enjoyed the presentation by Professor Andrew Morris. He defined the key challenges bringing data science into clinical practice, which are (i) the complexity of healthcare, (ii) the trustworthiness of the implemented data technologies, and (iii) the need to build adequate capacity to deliver data technologies.

2. I have learned about the formal meaning of integrated health and social care, its components, and funding. While I am more familiar with the healthcare side of the system, understanding social care and social services was most helpful. I have expanded my knowledge of the Scottish system to their English equivalents. 

3. Person-centred care is often mentioned in different contexts. I have learned its meaning through the four principles promoted by the Health Foundation. It is important to appreciate that patient-centred care is not about practitioners deciding the best care for their perceived person's needs but putting the person's views upfront.

While going through the week's content, I could appreciate the contemporary health and social care system, the legal framework driving its development and the challenges in delivering high-quality person-centred care.

How definitions and health differ across contexts and are still evolving, the concept of boundary setting and how that affects both health and social care systems. 
Outcomes-focused care and the impact it can have - I've heard about person-centered care before, even in sayings such as ""I am not my disease"", but haven't heard much focus on the outcomes different people can want in their lives with their care and how that should be implemented.

⭐ While preparing for my answer for the discussion boards, I did intense reading about local health care and social development history. This is very helpful for me to conduct a wider and detailed view on Scottish health and social care, as well as the integration between NHS Scotland and local authorities.

⭐ The posts on the discussion board helped me learn more about how health and social care are practised indifferent areas/counties.

Week 1: Health and Social Care Delivery and Organisation (⭐⭐⭐❓)","⭐️ The concept that ‘Social care is not only protecting people who are at risk but equally to all citizens.’ is intriguing to me. Growing up in Hong Kong, which is facing the challenge of an aging population, many people tend to relate social care support with the elderly or those with physical needs.

⭐️ The forms of care services in Scotland and the UK are very different from Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, people do not prefer to receive or provide care at home. This might be linked to certain Chinese superstitions that could disrupt the Feng Shui at home, or maybe just due to the affordability of public hospitals or daycare centers, as not many people can afford to hire nurse agencies or personal assistants at home.

⭐️ The collection of social care data could be difficult due to the challenges presented by unpaid carers and self-employed primary healthcare providers. This aspect of data collection had not been within my previous areas of interest so it is a new idea for me.

Based on these factors, it seems apparent to me that more of a preventative instead of reactive view needs to be included in response to the emergence of these chronic conditions. 

⭐ I now have a much broader view of what social care is. Before this week I would have struggled to define it with any accuracy, but I now understand what it encompasses. I'm also aware of why structural differences between health and social care systems developed due to the legislative history, in the UK.

⭐ I also gained an appreciation for the different challenges regarding data collection and sharing in the social care setting, as there is far lower utilisation of digital systems and standardisation. This makes it much more difficult to use data science approaches currently to drive improvement to social care services compared to healthcare.

❓ I would like to learn more about the data science approaches to convert unstructured data to structured data, as mentioned by Professor Andrew Morris. I think this is a very interesting prospect to be able to use computer science methodologies to access useful information within non-standardised written notes or medical imaging.

Week 3: Data Ownership and Management (⭐⭐⭐❓)","Information/data security is not provided solely by the property of secrecy of the data (also - and perhaps more properly - called confidentiality). Data security, in fact, also encompasses and is grounded in integrity and availability of the data, that is, its completeness and accuracy, as well as the ability to let selected individuals or entities look into them, when desired or required.
It's extremely important to subject patients and individuals in general to an informed consent when it comes to gather, manage, and make use of their data. Consent can be either explicit (also called opt-in), or it can also be implicit (opt-out), the latter taking place when the consent to treatment of the data is consider implied in the activity the individuals are taking part in. 
I have learned that R studio can leverage not just R code chunks, but also other programming languages, such as YAML, as well as various types of files, like .csl files, all this coming in extremely handy both for clarity of explanation/visualization and ease of use of the program.
? I would like to know much more about how different programming languages and files types can merge and be intertwined in R markdown files, becuase I feel the potentialities for data presentation and communication can be extraordinary."

Week 3: Data Ownership and Management (⭐⭐⭐❓)","*When it is not your data, we tend to think why not tend to open access for all data. However, I can see how there is some data that you may not want to be public. This week has made me respect that that data breaches may not be good for the people involved. It is an interesting perspective- because as a doctor I have always found that the more people are honest and open with their history (data) the better. 
* I enjoyed learning about the data protection impact assessment- I like the idea that there is a way for people to know whether or not sharing their data with this company/group is ‘safe’.
*Data is valuable- particularly data that is well organised and ‘useable’. It is interesting to see all the potential roles when working with data. I think Healthcare has tended to neglect the responsibility it bears with the data it has. We know that this is some of the most personal data a person can generate however while we tend to respect confidentiality when dealing directly with a patient- I personally have found that at the back-end: data is strewn across multiple different platforms; is not well organised; sometimes not well protected and is definitely a security risk in a lot of aspects.

⭐ I learned about data ethics, and what is required in terms of informed consent when collecting data. 

⭐ I used R-Markdown to follow through the example and made some further changes to explore how it works, I'm surprised at how easy it is to recreate reports in PDF and HTML format, which I think will be very useful for both this course and my work going forwards.

comprehensive approach that involves data cleaning, relevance assessment, accuracy evaluation, and integrity verification.
 STAR 2 – WEEK 4: Data quality is also comprised of uniqueness, a characteristic for which each record in a database should appear only once, eliminating duplication and overlaps.

STAR 3 – WEEK 4: Deterministic data linkage, which relies on exact matching of unique identifiers, is not always feasible due to data inconsistencies and missing information. In this cases, probabilistic data linkage comes in handy as a valuable alternative for linking records across datasets, and it leverages the probabilities of different rows representing the same entity.

QUESTION MARK – WEEK 4: I would like to know how we can effectively utilize probabilistic data linkage when deterministic linkage is not feasible, considering the potential for false matches due to similar values or the absence of significant differences between groups, which would – if present – allow for high-confidence probabilistic matching."

In addition to the more renowned quantitative data, qualitative data also takes an important role in data analysis, being able to describe phenomena that cannot easily be quantified, measured or described by mere numbers. Examples are opinions: not always can they be measured on scales from 1 to 10, since they often involve multi-factorial judgments.

Star 2. Along with right_join(), left_join(), full_join() and inner_join(), I've found out that anti_join() can also be used in R. Simply put, it basically takes one dataset and subtracts off of it the intersection that happens to exist with the rows of another dataset.

Star 3. R Studio offers several very handy packages complementing the tidyverse, such as janitor and lubridate. While the latter mainly deals with manipulating and formatting time and date data in reproducible and readable modes, janitor can be used to standardize and improve the readability of variable names.

Week 7: Good Coding Practice (⭐⭐⭐❓)","* I learnt about good practice for naming files e.g. short and relevant, no special characters, use underscores, don't assume case dependency and write dates consistently. I also learnt how to code to set the working directory in R. 

* I learnt to set up a github repositiory, which does actually seem to work. I found that I needed to set my name and email in command prompt, which wasn't in the tutorial notes, but I have done that now. Hopefully this will be really useful for version control. 

* I learnt about good coding practice including commenting in the code and formatting code. For commenting, I liked the technique of using hashes to add comments, especially in the middle of pipes to explain what different lines do. For formatting, I learn from the lecture about how the indenting makes it easier to read, but may mean that you have a very long code in terms of rows and that is OK if it is easier to read. 

? I'd like to understand more about GitHub. For example, how is it doing version control and how do you recover previous files beyond the most recently saved, I'd also like to understand if I should have multiple folders for different bits or work, or just create a folder in the repository I've created.

Week 8: Data Science in Health and Social Care","Systems thinking is one area of data science capable of addressing complex, multi-faceted and multi-variable issues, just like real-world problems. It aims to define the boundaries (sometimes not so clear or strict) of a system’s elements and to understand how these elements interact with each other.
 Systems thinking makes use of some key terms to try and fix and describe the system’s characteristics, such as system boundaries, system of interest, system environment, inputs/outputs, purpose, components, relationships, interfaces, constraints, and emergence.
 Data is being stored in ""safe havens"" or ""trusted research environments"" (TREs) by various organizations, including healthcare providers and governmental organizations, this process resulting in fairly a fragmented data landscape and thousands of scattered data resources. This raises the necessity to collaboration between countries and at least some of the private companies to increase access and visibility of this data.

Week 9: Data-Driven Innovation (⭐⭐⭐❓)","The model and its design must be carefully considered before implementing new systems in the social and health care sectors. Some of the difficulties that can be experienced in this sense are: setting the right goals, upsetting or profoundly amend current processes, inadequate assistance and design, making quick adjustments, and taking stakeholders' needs into account are some of the difficulties.
 Data-driven innovation (DDI) is an area of data science and research that harnesses data and analytics to drive innovation potentially in all sectors of society, and can yield significant economic and social benefits.
 Also international organizations like the OECD recognize the transformative power of data analytics and its potential to boost growth. Data is, in fact, considered as a fully-fledged capital asset, since it can be reused and linked to produce valuable insights and to produce returns.
 ? – A question raising automatically is: since data is a capital asset, shouldn’t part of it have a cost or an economic price when it is delivered from users (e.g., patients) to the organizations collecting this data?"

Week 10: Impact and Implementation (⭐⭐⭐❓)","Achieving successful change management does not only require modifying protocols and workflows, but also effectively addressing behavioral change, as individuals must adapt their behaviors to embrace organizational transformations.
 The failure to adequately address the behavioral aspects has actually been demonstrate to be a very common pitfall in change management, this often resulting in a high rate of change initiative failures. Studies have shown that a significant portion of change initiatives fail to achieve their objectives, highlighting the importance of considering behavioral factors.
 The so-called “theory of planned behavior” (TPB) explains how individuals make decisions about their behavior. It proposes that intentions to engage in a particular behavior are influenced by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Strong intentions lead to stronger behavior change, and the TPB can be and has been applied to a wide range of behaviors, with interventions designed to target various factors and increase the likelihood of behavior change.
 ? – I wonder interventions based on TPB could be made mandatory in some work environments, where cooperation is hindered and often suffers tremendously from the presence of powerful non-cooperative individuals, whose behaviours should be forced to change for the benefit of the entire organization (e.g., a hospital or a hospital department)."
